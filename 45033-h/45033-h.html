        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We all know what
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“Grand Tour”</span> meant a few
        generations ago, and how without it no gentleman’s education was
        considered complete. Now-a-days the journey can be made by almost any
        one who can command thirty or forty pounds, and the only really grand
        tour left is that around <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page2">[pg
        2]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
        world. M. Verne tells us—inferentially, at all events—that it can be
        made in eighty days, while Puck, as we know, speaks of putting a
        <span class="tei tei-q">“girdle round the earth in forty
        minutes.”</span> But this statement of the popular French author,
        like many others put forth in his graphic and picturesque works, must
        be taken <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">cum grano salis</span></span>. It <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">could</span></span> be,
        undoubtedly, but it is very questionable whether any one has yet
        accomplished the feat. Could one ensure the absolute <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“connection”</span> as it is technically termed, of all
        the steamship lines which would have to be employed it might be done;
        or better, one vessel with grand steaming and sailing qualities might
        perform the <span class="tei tei-q">“Voyage Round the World”</span>
        in the given time. But M. Jules Verne, it will be remembered, paints
        his hero as landing at various points, and as performing acts of
        bravery and chivalry <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">en route</span></span>, such as the episode of
        rescuing a Hindoo widow from the Suttee; finding time to lounge and
        drink in San Francisco <span class="tei tei-q">“saloons,”</span> and
        being attacked by Indians, who would wreck the overland train; and
        still, with all delays, he is able to reach London in time to win his
        wager. The very idea of describing a journey round the world as an
        act of eccentricity is peculiarly French. The Englishman who can
        afford to make it is especially envied by his friends, and not
        considered mildly mad. We have before us a list of books of travel,
        all published within the last few years, and in circulation at the
        ordinary libraries. Thirteen of these works describe voyages round
        the world, and they are mostly the productions of amateur rather than
        of professional writers. So easy, indeed, is the trip now-a-days,
        that two of these records are modestly and deprecatingly described as
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Rambles,”</span> while one of the best of
        them is the work of a clever and enthusiastic lady,<a id="noteref_1"

        would put to shame the land-lubber described in a very old song:—</p>

        to South Australia with a Lady, thence <span class=

        Paris with only seven and a half francs in her pocket, and yet
        managed to go round the entire globe. It must be admitted that she
        had many friends abroad who helped her, and passed her on to others
        who could and did assist her in every way. Still, the voyages and
        travels she made denote the possession of a goodly amount of
        pluck.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The item of speed
        is of great importance, and may well be considered in connection with
        a voyage round the globe. Verne’s title would have been deemed the
        raving of a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page3">[pg 3]</span><a name=
        "Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>lunatic had it been
        published before the age of steam, while in the first days of that
        great power which has now revolutionised the world it would have been
        regarded as absurd. The wooden Cunarder which, forty years ago,
        conveyed Charles Dickens on his first trip to America took double the
        ordinary time occupied now in making the voyage; and as a journalist
        has said, between such a vessel <span class="tei tei-q">“and such
        ships as the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Arizona</span></span> (Guion line), the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=

        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">City of
        Berlin</span></span> (Inman line), and the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Gallia</span></span>
        (Allan line), there is undoubtedly not less difference than between
        the Edinburgh or Glasgow mail-coaches and a modern express
        train.”</span> The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Arizona</span></span> has made the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">round</span></span>
        trip—that is, the voyage from Queenstown, Ireland, to Sandy Hook, New
        York, and back again—in fifteen days. The Inman line has been
        specially celebrated for quick passages, whilst their <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“crack”</span> steamer, the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">City of
        Berlin</span></span>, has made the single trip outwards in seven
        days, fourteen hours, and twelve minutes, and inwards in seven days,
        fifteen hours, and forty-eight minutes. The <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">City of
        Brussels</span></span> and the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">City of
        Richmond</span></span> have done nearly as well, while other
        steamships of the same line have made the trip in a very few hours
        and minutes more time. Think of considering minutes in a voyage of
        3,000 miles! The magnificent steamship named after the Orient Company
        has made the voyage from England to Australia in thirty-seven and a
        half days, or not very far from half the time occupied by other
        steamships a few years ago. This grand vessel is said to be only
        exceeded in size by the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Great Eastern</span></span>; she has a
        displacement of 9,500 tons and indicated horse-power of 5,400, and
        carries coal enough for her entire voyage—some 3,000 to 4,000 tons.
        But she is not to remain unchallenged, for, at the time these pages
        are being written, the Barrow Shipbuilding Company is constructing
        for the Inman line Atlantic service a still larger iron vessel, with
        engines of 8,500 horse-power, capable of propelling her at the rate
        of sixteen or seventeen knots; she will have four masts and three
        funnels. And yet another vessel of equal or greater power has been
        put on the stocks for the Cunard Company. Again, the largest
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">steel</span></span> steamship, or ship of any
        kind, has been launched at Dumbarton. She is intended largely for the
        cattle trade between the River Plate, Canada, and England. She is
        over 4,000 gross tonnage, and has been christened the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Buenos
        Ayrean</span></span>. The sums of money invested in the construction
        of these superb vessels are enormous. The <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Orient</span></span>
        is said to have cost, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">without</span></span> her fittings, little less
        than £150,000, her engines alone involving the expenditure of
        one-third of that amount. And yet a third-class or steerage ticket to
        the Antipodes by her costs only fifteen guineas, while the emigrant
        can go out to the United States or Canada by almost any one of the
        finest steamships of the various Atlantic services for six
        guineas.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many routes might,
        of course, be taken round the world, England being the eventual goal
        in all cases. As quaint Sir John Mandeville says, in the first
        chapter of his <span class="tei tei-q">“Travels”</span>:—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“In the Name of God Glorious and Allemyghty, he that wil
        passe over the See to go to the City of Jerusalem, he may go by many
        Weyes, bothe on See and Lande, aftre the Contree that hee cometh fro:
        manye of hem comen to an ende. But troweth not that I wil telle you
        alle the Townes and Cytees and Castelles that Men schaslle go by: for

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Although,”</span> says Mr. Simpson, the popular artist,
        in his work entitled <span class="tei tei-q">“Meeting <span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“Boke”</span> that going all round the world
        was not unknown even before his time.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The world is wide,”</span> yet the practical lines for a
        journey of this sort are very limited. There is the Siberian overland
        route, leading by St. Petersburg, Moscow, from which it goes about
        straight east through Siberia to Lake Baikal; and then there is about
        a month’s journey south, over the Mongolian Desert to Peking; or it
        may be varied by descending the great Amoor River, on which the
        Russians have a number of steamers, to Nicolaiefsk; thence sailing to
        San Francisco, and home by America and the Atlantic. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“When,”</span> says Mr. Simpson, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the Shah and Baron Reuter have made railways through
        Persia it may <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page5">[pg
        5]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>add
        slightly to the choice; perhaps when Russia civilises the whole of
        Central Asia it may open up a new route as far as China; but till
        that happy period, unless the traveller is willing, and at the same
        time able, to become a dervish, or something of that sort, like M.
        Vambéry, he had better not take the chance of risk in these regions.
        Many attempts have been made to pass from India to China, and
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice
        versâ</span></span>, but as yet no one has succeeded. The
        difficulties of such an enterprise are very great, not so much from
        the races of people as from the physical character of that region of
        the earth. These difficulties can, however, be overcome; and in
        evidence of this, we have perhaps one of the most wonderful
        expeditions of modern times in the journey of the two Jesuit
        missionaries, Huc and Gabet, from Peking to Lhassa. When they were
        ordered to leave the capital of the Great Lama, they wished to do so
        in the direction of Calcutta, as being by far the nearest, and, at
        the same time, the easiest way; but in vain. By a policy rigidly
        insisted upon by the Chinese Government, no one is allowed to pass
        anywhere along the frontiers between China and India.”</span> This
        writer adds, that when travelling in Tibet he heard of many parties
        who wished to cross the frontier in that quarter, with the purpose
        only of having a few days’ shooting of some particular animal which
        they wanted to bring home; but he never knew of any one who was able
        to gratify his wish. One man told him that he had taken some pieces
        of very bright red cloth and other tempting bribes for the officials
        on the Chinese side, but it was all to no purpose. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It is not easy to understand why this intense jealousy
        should exist, but about the fact there can be no doubt.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But dismissing any
        and all ideas of journeying by land through Europe, Asia, or Africa,
        our trip will be almost entirely by sea, the trans-continental route
        across America being excepted. Practically that route is to-day the
        best if you would reach quickly and pleasantly any part of the
        Pacific. The great railway is an enormous link binding the Atlantic
        and Pacific Oceans together. The Suez Canal and the Panama route have
        been mentioned in these pages—the first very fully; and place must
        certainly be had for a description of a railroad which is so
        intimately connected with the sea. But first we must reach it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The passage across
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“Great Atlantic Ferry”</span> is now one
        of ease, and in the case of first-class passengers almost luxury. How
        different was it about forty years ago, even on the best steamships
        of that period! Charles Dickens has graphically described his
        experiences on board the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Britannia</span></span>, one of the earliest of
        the Cunard fleet, in one of his least-read works<a id="noteref_4"

        in the present generation. The little cupboard dignified by the name
        of <span class="tei tei-q">“state-room;”</span> the dingy saloon
        likened <span class="tei tei-q">“to a gigantic hearse with windows in
        the sides;”</span> the melancholy stove at which the forlorn stewards
        were rubbing their hands; the stewardess, whom Dickens blesses
        <span class="tei tei-q">“for her piously fraudulent account of
        January voyages;”</span> the excitement before leaving the dock; the
        captain’s boat and the dapper little captain; the last late mail
        bags, and the departure, are all sketched from nature, as the great
        novelist alone could depict them. And now they are off.</p>

        mer</span></span> on an English or Irish Channel boat than there is
        on the voyage across the Atlantic. The waves in such channels are
        more cut up and <span class="tei tei-q">“choppy”</span> than are
        those of the broad ocean. The employment of the twin-boat,
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Calais-Douvres</span></span>, has mitigated much
        of the horrors of one of our Channel lines. It is curious to note the
        fact that Indians often use a couple of canoes in very much the same
        manner as did the designer of the doubled-hulled vessel just
        mentioned. The writer has seen, in the Straits of Fuca, natives
        conveying all their possessions on the top of planks, placed over and
        lashed to two canoes. One suggestion for the improvement of the
        steamboat service across the Channel to France is to construct an
        enormous vessel, 650 feet long and 150 wide, a ship as long as the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Great
        Eastern</span></span> and twice her beam, to be propelled by both
        paddles and screws. She is to be capable of carrying several trains,
        and is to have a roofed station on board, with all the necessary
        saloons. Floating platforms are to connect this great steam
        ferry-boat with the shore rails, so that it can start or arrive at
        any time of the tide.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        answer; while some are bold enough to answer, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yes.”</span> But Dickens noticed that the first day very
        few remained long over their wine, and that everybody developed an
        unusual love of the open air. Still, with the exception of one lady,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“who had retired with some precipitation at

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The subject of sea
        sickness is an unpleasant one, and cannot occupy much space here.
        Every old and many a new traveller has a remedy for it, so possibly
        the mention of our mode of prevention may be permitted here. It is
        simply for the sufferer to wear a very tight belt round the waist. It
        has been recommended to many fellow-passengers, and its use has
        proved invariably beneficial. The unusual motion, and sometimes the
        smells of the vessel, are the cause of the nausea felt. The tightened
        belt steadies the whole body, and, provided the sufferer be not
        bilious, soon braces him up corporally and mentally. If he
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">is</span></span> bilious (which he often is on
        account of leave-takings and festivities prior to his departure) the
        worst thing possible is generally recommended him—the ordinary brandy
        on board. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Very</span></span> fine old liqueur cognac in
        small doses can, however, be taken with advantage. An authority (Dr.
        Chapman) recommends the application of ice, enclosed in an
        india-rubber bag, to the spinal cord. In various travellers’ works,
        marmalade, cayenne pepper, port wine, chutnee, and West India
        pickles, are prescribed for the malady. The invalid would do much
        better by eating fresh or canned fruits of a cooling nature. But to
        return to the voyage. Dickens describes the first night at sea in
        feeling language.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“this is a very striking time on shipboard.
        Afterwards, and when its novelty had long worn off, it never ceased
        to have a peculiar interest and charm for me. The gloom through which
        the great black mass holds its direct and certain course; the rushing
        water, plainly heard, but dimly seen; the broad white glistening
        track that follows in the vessel’s wake; the men on the look-out
        forward, who would be scarcely visible against the dark sky but for
        their blotting out some score of glistening stars; the helmsman at
        the wheel, with the illuminated card before him shining, a speck of
        light amidst the darkness, like something sentient and of Divine
        intelligence; the melancholy sighing of the wind through block and
        rope and chain; the gleaming forth of light from every crevice, nook,
        and tiny piece of glass about the decks, as though the ship were
        filled with fire in hiding, ready to burst through any outlet, wild
        with its resistless power of death and ruin.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Irresistibly
        comic, as well as true, is his description of the ship during bad
        weather. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is the third morning. I am
        awakened out of my sleep by a dismal shriek from my wife, who demands
        to know whether there’s any danger. I rouse myself and look out of
        bed. The water-jug is plunging and leaping like a lively dolphin; all
        the smaller articles are afloat, except my shoes, which are stranded
        on a carpet-bag, high and dry, like a couple of coal-barges. Suddenly
        I see them spring into the air, and behold the looking-glass, which
        is nailed to the wall, sticking fast upon the ceiling. At the same
        time the door entirely disappears, and a new one is opened in the
        floor. Then I begin to comprehend that the state-room is standing on
        its head.</span></p>

        started forward, and to be a creature actively running of its own
        accord, with broken knees and failing legs, through every variety of

        constantly. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* And so she goes on staggering, heaving,
        wrestling, leaping, diving, jumping, pitching, throbbing, rolling,
        and rocking, and going through all these movements sometimes by
        turns, and sometimes all together, until one feels disposed to roar
        for mercy.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dickens gives a
        droll account of a ridiculous situation in which he was placed.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“About midnight we shipped a sea, which
        forced its way through the skylights, burst open the doors above, and
        came raging and roaring down into the ladies’ cabin, to the
        unspeakable consternation of my wife and a little Scotch lady—who, by
        the way, had previously sent a message to the captain by the
        stewardess, requesting him, with her compliments, to have a steel
        conductor immediately attached to the top of every mast and to the
        chimney, in order that the ship might not be struck by lightning.
        They and the handmaid before-mentioned, being in such ecstasies of
        fear that I scarcely knew what to do with them, I naturally bethought
        myself of some restorative or comfortable cordial; and nothing better
        occurring to me at the moment than hot brandy-and-water, I procured a
        tumblerful without delay. It being impossible to stand or sit without
        holding on, they were all heaped together in one corner of a long
        sofa—a fixture extending entirely across the cabin—where they clung
        to each other, in momentary expectation of being drowned. When I
        approached this place with my specific, and was about to administer
        it, with many consolatory expressions, to the nearest sufferer, what
        was my dismay to see them all roll slowly down to the other end! And
        when I staggered to that end, and held out the glass once more, how
        immensely baffled were my good intentions by the ship giving another
        lurch, and their all rolling back again! I suppose I dodged them up
        and down this sofa for at least a quarter of an hour, without
        reaching them once; and by the time I did catch them the
        brandy-and-water was diminished by constant spilling to a
        tea-spoonful.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What a difference
        to the accommodations and comfort of most modern steamships, with
        their luxurious saloons placed amidships, where there is least
        motion; their spacious and airy state-rooms, warmed by steam, water
        laid on, and fitted with electric bells; their music-room with piano
        and harmonium, their smoking-room, bath-rooms, library, and even
        barber’s shop. The table is as well served as at the best hotel
        ashore, and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">menu</span></span> for the day is as extensive
        as that of a first-class restaurant, while everything that may be
        required in the drinkables, from modest bottled beer to rare old
        wine, is to be obtained from the steward. And provided that the
        passengers assimilate reasonably well, there will be enjoyable games,
        music, and possibly private theatricals and other regularly organised
        entertainments. The idea of a <span class="tei tei-q">“Punch and
        Judy”</span> in the middle of the Atlantic seems rather funny; but we
        have known of an instance in which even this form of amusement has
        been provided on board a great steamship! On long voyages it is not
        by any means uncommon for some one to start a MS. daily or weekly
        journal, to which many of the passengers contribute. Such have often
        been published afterwards for private circulation, as affording
        reminiscences of a pleasant voyage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then there is the
        pleasure of discovering <span class="tei tei-q">“a sail in
        sight,”</span> and of watching it grow larger by degrees as the
        vessels approach each other. The <span class="tei tei-q">“look
        out”</span> is kept by some passengers almost as persistently as by
        the sailors detailed for the purpose. Perhaps, again, the captain or
        officers have let out the fact that they should pass one of their own
        or some rival company’s <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page10">[pg
        10]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>vessel that day. How many eyes are strained
        after that first mere thread of smoke on the horizon! What ringing
        cheers as the two great steamships near each other! What an amount of
        anxious enthusiasm when it is known that a boat is coming off from
        the other vessel, and what feverish excitement to learn all the news!
        They may have been seven or eight days without any, and in that time
        what may not have occurred in the history of nations!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then, again, the
        sea itself, in its varying beauty or grandeur, has for most
        travellers a great interest. Is there not a chance of seeing an
        iceberg, a whale, or even the great sea serpent?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In March-April,
        1869, the writer crossed the Atlantic in splendid weather. The ocean
        was, for the ten days occupied on the passage, almost literally as
        calm as a lake; even the lady passengers emerged from their cabins
        two or three days before they would otherwise have ventured forth.
        Among them was one lady seventy-five years of age, who was running
        away—so she informed the passengers—from her husband, and going to
        join her children in the States. This female had <span class=

        was going to end her days in peace. Here was a champion of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“woman’s rights!”</span> Alas! on arrival in
        New York there was no one to receive her, and she was taken back on
        board the steamer. What became of her afterwards we know
        not.</p><a name="illo_013" id="illo_013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The woes of
        steerage passengers have been graphically described by Charles
        Dickens. He tells us that <span class="tei tei-q">“unquestionably any
        man who retained his cheerfulness among the steerage accommodations
        of that noble and fast-sailing packet, the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Screw</span></span>,
        was solely indebted to his own resources, and shipped his good humour
        like his provisions, without any contribution or assistance from the
        owners. A dark, low, stifling cabin, surrounded by berths filled to
        overflowing with men, women, and children, in various stages of
        sickness and misery, is not the liveliest place of assembly at any
        time; but when it is so crowded, as the steerage cabin of the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Screw</span></span> was every passage out, that
        mattrasses and beds are heaped on the floor, to the extinction of
        everything like comfort, cleanliness, and decency, it is liable to
        operate not only as a pretty strong barrier against amiability of
        temper, but as a positive encourager of selfish and rough
        humours.”</span> Dickens follows with a dismally correct picture of
        the passengers, with their shabby clothes, paltry stores of poor food
        and other supplies, and their wealth of family. He adds that every
        kind of suffering bred of poverty, illness, banishment, and tedious
        voyaging in bad weather was crammed into that confined space, and the
        picture, almost revolting in its naked truthfulness, was not
        overdrawn in those days. It could not be written, however, of any
        steerage whatever in our times, for partly from governmental care,
        partly from the general improvement in means of travel, partly from
        competition and the praiseworthy desire of the owners to earn a high
        character for their vessels’ accommodations, the steerage of to-day
        is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">comparatively</span></span> decent; although it
        is not yet that which it should be, nor has the progress of
        improvement kept anything like pace with railway accommodation of the
        cheaper kind. Yet one would think it to the interest of owners<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1879 nearly
        118,000 steerage passengers left the port of Liverpool for the United
        States. It should be noted that this was from <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></span> port,
        undeniably the principal one for emigration, but still by no means
        the only British one used for that purpose. Observe further that it
        was for America alone that these emigrants were bound. According to
        the United States census of 1870, there were at that time 5,600,000
        human beings in the country who were foreign born, and this number
        has since gone on increasing to a very large extent. Nine-tenths of
        them at the least crossed the Great Ferry in ships bearing the Union
        Jack, and of these, three-fourths or more crossed as steerage
        passengers. Hence the importance of the question.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Latterly a
        considerable amount of attention has been given to the sub-division
        of the steerage space, so that, when practicable, friends and
        families may remain together. Married people and single women have
        now separate quarters. The sleeping accommodations are the weak
        point. They are simply rough wooden berths, and the passenger has to
        furnish his own bedding, as well as plate, mug, knife, fork, spoon,
        and water-can. The provisions are now-a-days generally ample, and on
        some lines are provided <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ad libitum</span></span>. The bill of fare is
        pretty usually as follows. Breakfast: coffee, fresh bread or biscuit,
        and butter, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">or</span></span> oatmeal porridge and molasses;
        Dinner: soup, beef or pork, and potatoes—fish may be substituted for
        the meat; on Sunday pudding is often added; Tea: tea, biscuit and
        butter. Three quarts of fresh water are allowed daily. A passenger
        who has a few shillings to spend can often obtain a few extras from
        the steward, and many, of course, take a small stock of the minor
        luxuries of life on board with him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To those of small
        means who are contemplating emigration, the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Intermediate”</span> (second-class) on board some of the
        Atlantic steamers to the States and Canada can be commended. For a
        couple of guineas over the steerage rates, excellent state-rooms,
        generally with four to six berths in each, furnished with bedding and
        lavatory arrangements, are provided. The intermediate passenger has a
        separate general saloon, and the table is well provided with good
        plain living. As the steerage passenger has to provide so many things
        for himself, it is almost as cheap to travel
        second-class.</p><a name="illo_018" id="illo_018" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Almost every
        reader will remember Martin Chuzzlewit and Mark Tapley on board the
        wretched <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Screw</span></span>. How, for example,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the latter awoke with a dim idea that he was
        dreaming of having gone to sleep in a four-post bedstead which had
        turned bottom upwards in the course of the night,”</span> for which
        there seemed some reason, as <span class="tei tei-q">“the first
        objects he recognised when he opened his eyes were his own heels
        looking down at him, as he afterwards observed, from a nearly
        perpendicular elevation.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“This is the
        first time as ever I stood on my head all night,”</span> observed
        Mark.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The lesson taught
        by Dickens regarding the necessity of keeping up one’s spirits on
        board ship, and better, of helping to keep up those of others, as
        exemplified by poor Tapley, is a very important one. If anything will
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        crowded ship will do it. Who that has read can ever forget Mark, when

        of them young ’uns, according to custom.”</span> <span class=

        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">could</span></span>
        make tea, but any one can wash a boy.’</span> The woman, who was
        delicate and ill, felt and understood his kindness—as well she might,
        for she had been covered every night with his great coat, while he
        had for his own bed the bare boards and a rug.”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If a gleam of sun shone out of the dark sky,”</span>
        continues Dickens, <span class="tei tei-q">“down Mark tumbled into
        the cabin, and presently up he came again with a woman in his arms,
        or half-a-dozen children, or a man, or a bed, or a saucepan, or a
        basket, or something animate or inanimate that he thought would be
        the better for the air. If an hour or two of fine weather in the
        middle of the day tempted those who seldom or never came on deck at
        other times to crawl into the long-boat, or lie down upon the spare
        spars and try to eat, there in the centre of the group was Mr.
        Tapley, handing about salt beef and biscuit, or dispensing tastes of
        grog, or cutting up the children’s provisions with his pocket-knife
        for their greater ease and comfort, or reading aloud from a venerable
        newspaper, or singing some roaring old song to a select party, or
        writing the beginnings of letters to their friends at home for people
        who couldn’t write, or cracking jokes with the crew, or nearly
        getting blown over the side, or emerging half-drowned from a shower
        of spray, or lending a hand somewhere or other: but always doing
        something for the general entertainment.”</span></p><a name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dickens drew his
        picture from life, and although an extreme case, there are many Mark
        Tapleys yet to be met. And indeed, unless the emigrant can remain
        happy and jovial amid the unmistakable hardships of even the best
        regulated steerage, he had better have stopped at home. If he can
        stand them well, he is of the stuff that will make a good colonist or
        settler, ready to <span class="tei tei-q">“rough it”</span> at any
        time. Before leaving the subject of steerage passengers and
        emigrants, it may be well to note that the United States Government
        does all in its power on their arrival in New York to protect them
        from imposition and furnish them with trustworthy information. At the
        depôt at Castle Gardens, where third-class passengers land, there are
        interpreters, money-changers, railway-ticket offices, and rooms for
        their accommodation; and it is very much their own fault if they
        slide into the pitfalls of New York—for New York <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">has</span></span>
        pitfalls, like every other great city.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The risks of the
        voyage across the Atlantic are not really as great as those of ships
        passing southwards through the Bay of Biscay, which is the terror of
        passengers to Australia, India, China, and other points in the
        Orient. At the beginning of 1880 the fine <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">S.S.</span></span>
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Chimborazo</span></span> returned with
        difficulty to Plymouth, three persons having been washed overboard,
        and one killed from injuries received on board. Off Ushant a
        formidable gale arose, and the vessel began to roll heavily, while on
        the following morning the storm had become a hurricane, and the water
        was taken on board and below in volumes, threatening a fate similar
        to that experienced by the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">London</span></span>. Just before 9 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 75%">A.M.</span></span> an
        enormous sea broke over the ship, heeling her over and washing the
        deck with resistless force. The steam launch, six heavy boats, the
        smoking room, saloon companion, and everything on the spar deck, were
        in three seconds carried overboard among the breakers as though they
        were mere children’s toys, while, in addition to the losses of life
        already mentioned, seventeen other passengers were more or less
        injured. Just before the ship was struck the smoking-room was full of
        passengers, who were requested by the captain to leave it to give
        place to some helpless sheep who were floundering about, and to this
        fact they owed their lives. <span class="tei tei-q">“As,”</span> said
        a leading journal, <span class="tei tei-q">“the stricken ship entered
        Plymouth Harbour on Tuesday morning, her shattered stanchions and
        skylights, her damaged steering apparatus, and the heap of wreckage
        lying upon her deck, proclaimed the fury of the tremendous ordeal
        through which she had passed, and awakened many a heartfelt and
        silent prayer of gratitude among her rescued passengers, as they
        contemplated the evidences of the peril from which they had so
        narrowly escaped.”</span> It is in moments such as these that the
        poverty of human words is keenly felt. There can be no doubt that,
        but for the excellent seamanship displayed by Captain Trench and his
        officers there would have been a sadder story to relate.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sufficient mention
        of New York has already been made in this work. The tourist or
        traveller bound round the world, viâ the great trans-continental
        railway and San Francisco, has at starting from the commercial
        metropolis of America, and as far as Omaha, a choice of routes, all
        the fares being identical for a <span class="tei tei-q">“through
        ticket”</span> to the Pacific. You may go among the Pennsylvanian
        mountains and valleys, and catch many a glimpse of the coal and coal
        <span class="tei tei-q">“ile”</span> fields; the country generally
        being thickly wooded. The Pennsylvania, Pittsburg, and Fort Wayne
        Railway passes through really grand scenery, and the construction of
        the road has been a work of great difficulty, involving extensive
        cuttings and embankments and long tunnels. The road takes a
        serpentine course among the mountains, and at one point, known as the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Horse-shoe Bend,”</span> the line curves
        round so much that it almost meets itself again. A train following
        your own appears to be going in the opposite direction. The only city
        of any importance on this route, before Chicago is reached, is
        Pittsburg, the busy, coaly, sooty, and grimy—a place reminding one of
        Staffordshire, and abounding in iron and cutlery works. It is
        situated among really charming scenery, near where the Monongahela,
        Alleghany, and Ohio rivers meet, and is an ugly blot among the
        verdant and peaceful surroundings. After leaving Pittsburg the
        railroad passes through a charmingly fresh and fruitful country,
        watered by the Ohio. <span class="tei tei-q">“Long stretches of green
        meadows, shut in by hill and dale, shady nooks, cosy farm-houses, and
        handsome villas, steamers, barges, boats, and timber-rafts—almost as
        large as those famous Rhine rafts—on the river, make up a varied and
        most attractive scene.”</span> Next you reach Indiana, a country of
        fairly good soil, bad swamps, fearful fever and ague, and an indolent
        and shiftless people. In general terms it is a good country to
        leave.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the tourist’s
        popular route from New York to Chicago is that briefly known as
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The Great Central.”</span> At Niagara it
        passes over a bridge spanning the river below the great Falls, where
        a tolerable view is obtainable. Most tourists naturally stop a day or
        two at the Falls, where there are fine hotels. They have been so
        often described that every schoolboy knows all about them. They are
        especially worth seeing under their winter aspect, when miniature
        icebergs and floes are falling, crashing, and grinding with the
        water. Below the Falls these will bank up to a considerable height,
        and the river is in places completely frozen over. From the rocks
        huge stalactites of hundreds of tons of ice depend. The contrast of
        the dashing green waters with the crystal ice and virgin snow around
        is very beautiful. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page15">[pg
        15]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Some
        idea of the volume of water may be gathered from this fact: the
        Niagara River a mile and a half above the Falls is two and a half
        miles wide, and is there very deep. At the Falls all this water is
        narrowed to about 800 yards in breadth. A traveller already
        mentioned<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href=
        "#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> thus
        describes her impressions:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Nor do I think that the most powerful imagination can,
        with its greatest effort, attain even an approximate notion of the
        awful sublimity of this natural wonder. Like all other stupendous
        things which the mind has been unaccustomed to measure and to
        contemplate, Niagara requires time to grow upon one. The mind also
        demands time to struggle up to its dimensions, and time to gather up
        its harmonies into the mighty tones which finally fill the soul with
        their overwhelming cadences, and whose theme, ever-varying but still
        the same—as in the hands of a Handel or a Beethoven—thunders through
        the whole extent of one’s being—<span class="tei tei-q">‘Almighty
        Power!’</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The chief impression produced upon the mind by Niagara
        is the perpetuity of immeasurable force and grandeur. This it is
        which lends such a strange fascination to the Falls; however
        pressingly one is desirous of getting away, one is obliged to turn
        back again, and yet again, like the disturbed needle to the magnetic
        pole. There is nothing in the way of natural scenery which has
        stamped itself so clearly, indelibly, and awfully on my mind as this
        gigantic magnificence; as this mighty body of waters, gliding
        stealthily but rapidly on its onward course above the Falls,
        springing forward more wildly, more exultingly, as it nears the
        brink, until it leaps over into the abyss to swell the mighty
        canticle, which, for thousands and thousands of years, by day and by
        night, through every season, has ascended in tones of subdued thunder
        to the Creator’s throne.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Passing over all
        intermediate points, the traveller at length reaches the Garden City,
        Chicago. This, which used to be counted a western city—it is 900
        miles west of New York—is now considered almost an eastern one. And
        it must be remembered that this place of half a million souls is a
        port. Large sailing-vessels and steamers enter and leave it daily,
        and through Lake Michigan and the chain of other lakes can reach the
        ocean direct. There are miles on miles of wharfs, and it is generally
        considered one of the <span class="tei tei-q">“livest”</span>
        business places in America. Handsomely laid-out and built, the city
        now hardly bears a trace of the terrific conflagration which in 1871
        laid three-fourths of the finest streets in ruins.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From Chicago to
        Omaha the various routes have little to interest the ordinary
        traveller, and so, while speeding on together, let us dine in a
        Pullman hotel car. On entering you will be presented with a
        bewildering bill of fare, commencing with soups and finishing with
        ice-cream and black coffee. The dinner is served on little separate
        tables, while the purity of the cloths and table napkins, the
        brightness of the plate, and the crystal clearness of the glass-ware,
        leave nothing to desire. You can have a glass of iced water, for they
        have an ice-cellar; you can obtain anything, from a bottle of beer to
        one of Burgundy, port, or champagne; and cigars are also kept
        <span class="tei tei-q">“en board;”</span> while at the particular
        point indicated you will not pay more than seventy-five cents (about
        three shillings) for the dinner. It must be admitted that the liquid
        refreshments are generally very dear: a <span class=

        fourth of a dollar) for any small drink, fifty cents for a very small
        bottle of Bass, and wines expensive in proportion. Still you dine at
        your ease and leisure, instead of rushing out with a crowd at the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“eating stations,”</span> where the trains
        usually stop three times a day. We have the authority of Mr. W. F.
        Rae for stating that <span class="tei tei-q">“no royal personage can

        "font-style: italic">proper</span></span> commences, although the
        various New York and other lines, as we have seen, connect with it.
        The river, irreverently known on the spot as <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The Great Muddy,”</span> from the colour of its water
        and its numerous sand and mud banks, is crossed at this point by a
        fine bridge. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Apropos</span></span> of the said banks, which
        are constantly shifting, a story is told of a countryman who, years
        ago, before the age of steam ferries, wanted to cross the Missouri
        near this point. He did not see his way till he observed a sand-bank
        <span class="tei tei-q">“washing-up,”</span> as they call it, to the
        surface of the water near the shore on which he stood. He jumped on
        it, and it shifted so rapidly that it took him clear across the
        river, and he was able to land on the opposite side! The story is an
        exaggerated version of fact. The shifting sand-banks make navigation
        perilous, and good river pilots command a high figure.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The literature of
        the railway has hardly yet been attempted. It is true that scarcely a
        day passes without something of interest transpiring in connection
        therewith: now some grand improvement, now a terrible accident or
        narrow escape, and now again the opening of some important line. The
        humours of railroad travel—good and bad—often enliven the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page17">[pg 17]</span><a name="Pg017"
        id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pages of our comic journals,
        while the strictly mechanical aspect of the subject is fully treated
        in technical papers. But the facts remain that all this is of a
        transient nature, and that the railway can hardly be said yet to have
        a literature of its own.</p><a name="illo_026" id="illo_026" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following
        episodes mainly refer to the grand railway under notice, which is by
        all odds the longest direct road on the surface of the globe. From
        New York to San Francisco the distance by this railway is 3,300
        miles, and the ticket for the through journey is about two feet long!
        This would be more justly described as a series of tickets or
        coupons. The writer has crossed the American continent twice by this
        route, his first trip having been made on its completion in 1869,
        when, as correspondent of a daily journal, he had ample facilities
        for examining it in detail. In Chicago he had the pleasure of meeting
        Mr. Pullman, who kindly furnished him with information which in those
        days, at all events, was new to the British public. He was even then
        trying to get his famous carriages introduced into England; as events
        proved, it took him several years to get them even tested. In this
        connection he is credited with a <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bon mot</span></span>.
        He was speaking of our land in the highest terms, but, like many
        Americans, did not think we adopted new ideas with sufficient
        readiness. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is a grand country,”</span>
        said he, <span class="tei tei-q">“a grand country. But you have to be
        born <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">very</span></span> young there;”</span> meaning
        that otherwise you might grow grey in the consummation of even a
        promising scheme.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page18">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the writer
        first crossed the continent the railway was very much in the rough.
        Rails laid at the rate of seven, and, on one occasion, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ten</span></span> miles
        a day, can hardly be implicitly relied upon; much of the road was
        flimsily ballasted, and many of the bridges were temporary wooden
        structures of a shaky order. The train had sometimes to literally
        crawl along; passengers would often get off and walk some distance
        ahead, easily beating the locomotives, and be found seated on the
        boulders at the side of the road, having had time for a quarter of an
        hour’s smoke. Mr. James Mortimer Murphy, in his <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Rambles in Northwestern America,”</span> gives some
        similar experiences on a still rougher line on which he travelled
        from Wallula, on the Columbia River, to a point in Washington
        Territory. The railroad was only fifteen miles long, and had wooden
        rails. Having secured an interview with the president, secretary,
        conductor, and brakesman of the road—represented by one and the same
        individual—he was booked as a passenger, and placed on some rough
        iron in an open truck, with instructions to cling to the sides, and
        be most careful not to stand on the floor if he cared anything about
        his limbs. The miserable little engine gave a grunt or two, several
        wheezy puffs, a cat-like scream, and finally got the train under
        weigh, proceeding at the headlong speed of two miles an hour,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“rocking,”</span> says the narrator,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“like a canoe in a cross sea. The gentleman
        who represented all the train officials did not get on the train, but
        told the engineer to go on, and he would overtake him in the course
        of an hour. Before I had proceeded half a mile I saw why I was not
        permitted to stand on the floor of the truck, for a piece of
        hoop-iron, which covered the wooden rails in some places, curled up
        into what is called a <span class="tei tei-q">‘snake head,’</span>
        and pushed through the wood with such force that it nearly stopped
        the train. After this was withdrawn the engine resumed its course,
        and at the end of seven hours hauled one weary passenger, with eyes
        made sore from the smoke, and coat and hat nearly burnt off by the
        sparks, into a station composed of a rude board shanty, through whose
        apertures the wind howled, having made the entire distance of fifteen
        miles in that time.”</span> The drivers of the passing <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“prairie schooners,”</span> as the waggons drawn by eight
        or more pairs of mules or oxen are called, occasionally challenged
        the president of the line to run a race with them in his old machine;
        but he scorned their offers, and kept quietly walking beside his
        train. This eccentric railway has since been superseded by one much
        more desirable, while in justice to the great line referred to, it
        must be said that it is now, and long has been, in admirable
        condition, and that it is crossed by numerous express, emigrant, and
        freight trains daily.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Indians have
        never given the trans-continental railway companies much trouble
        since the completion of the lines. Early in its history a story is
        told, however, of the Chien or Dog Indians, from whom the town of
        Cheyenne takes its name. They had a strong prejudice against the iron
        horse with the fiery eyes, and determined to vanquish him. Some
        thirty of them mounted their ponies, and urging them up the line,
        valiantly charged a coming train. It is perhaps unnecessary to state
        that fragments of defunct red men were found shortly afterwards
        strewed about the road, and that the tribe has not since repeated the
        experiment. Perhaps better is the true story of the Piute Indians of
        Nevada, who tried to catch a train, and found that they had
        <span class="tei tei-q">“caught a Tartar”</span> instead. Annoyed by
        the snorting monster, they laid in ambush, and as it approached
        dexterously threw a lasso, such as is used for catching cattle, over
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“smoke stack,”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page19">[pg 19]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>or funnel of the locomotive, while a
        number of them held on to the other end of the rope. The engine went
        on its way unharmed; but it is said that the eccentric gymnastics
        performed by the Indians, as they were pulled at twenty-five miles an
        hour over the rocks and boulders at the side of the track, were more
        amusing to the passengers than to themselves.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most readers will
        have heard of the celebrated <span class="tei tei-q">“Cape
        Horn,”</span> high up among the Sierra Nevada mountains, where the
        Central Pacific Railway rounds the edge of a fearful cliff. The
        traveller is there between six and seven thousand feet above the sea
        level; and at the particular point of which mention is now made there
        is a precipice descending almost perpendicularly to a depth of
        fifteen hundred feet. Above, again, rise the walls of the same rocky
        projection to a still greater height. The sublimity of the spot is
        undoubted, but as regards the passengers, the ridiculous too often
        appears upon the scene. Most ladies and many timid men audibly
        shudder at this juncture, and after taking a hasty glance downwards
        at the turbulent Truckee River dashing round the base of the
        precipice, retire to the other side of the carriage, where there is
        nothing but the prospect of a rough-hewn rocky wall a foot or so off
        the carriages. Is it with the idea of ballasting the train? Perhaps
        like the ostrich, they think themselves out of danger, when danger is
        hidden!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not very far from
        the above spot, on the western side of the mountains, where the
        grades are particularly steep, an accident occurred a few years ago
        which had more of the comic element than the serious. A train,
        proceeding at a rapid rate, broke in two, the locomotive and several
        carriages dashing on, while the second half of the train followed at
        slower speed. At length the foremost car of this part of the train
        left the rails, and breaking off from the couplings, turned bottom
        upwards on the embankment, just coming to an anchor at the edge of a
        ravine, into which, had it fallen, no one could have been saved. A
        husband of Falstaffian proportions was in one of the foremost
        carriages which had proceeded with the locomotive, and as soon as
        they stopped he scrambled off, running back to the scene of the
        accident, hurrying and stumbling and shinning himself on and over the
        rough roadway and obtrusive sleepers, for his wife was in one of the
        hindmost cars, and he feared the worst. At last he approached the
        wreck, where his wife was seen standing, calmly waving a
        handkerchief, she having climbed out through one of the windows,
        almost unhurt. She had just been tending the one damaged person of
        the whole number. That individual, in his anxiety to grasp something
        as the carriage overturned, had seized on the hot stove, and was
        badly, though not seriously, burned.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not altogether a
        nuisance is an institution inseparably connected with American
        trains—the peripatetic boy who offers you one minute a newspaper, the
        next a novel, and then anything from a cigar or a box of sweetmeats
        to a <span class="tei tei-q">“prize package.”</span> These latter are
        of all values, from a twenty-five cent package of stationery to a
        bound book at a dollar and a half, about one in a hundred of which
        may possibly contain a money prize. The writer had been a good
        customer as regards paper-covered novels, and his plan was to sell
        the books back at half-price, then purchasing a new story, and this,
        of course, suited the boys well enough. In consequence of these and
        other purchases, he was one day allowed to win a five-dollar
        <span class="tei tei-q">“greenback”</span> in a prize package. He was
        somewhat annoyed afterwards to find that he had been used really as
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“decoy duck.”</span> The news of his
        winnings flew through the carriage, and even through the train, and

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A newspaper is
        published regularly on the overland trains of the Pacific Railway.
        There are telegraph stations everywhere on the route, and the latest
        news is handed <span class="tei tei-q">“aboard”</span> to the editor,
        leader-writer, compositor, and pressman—represented by, or condensed
        into, one and the same individual—as soon as the train arrives, and
        is immediately <span class="tei tei-q">“set up”</span> and printed.
        Thus <span class="tei tei-q">“specials,”</span> <span class=

        "tei tei-q">“special extra specials”</span> follow one another in
        rapid succession, and keep the train alive with excitement.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A term which has
        come into vogue here originated on the Pacific Railway during the
        writer’s stay in California. A terrible accident occurred near
        Oakland, in which one <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page21">[pg
        21]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>train
        of the long cars usual in the United States met and literally
        <span class="tei tei-q">“telescoped”</span> another. The expression
        was used in a rather curious way in San Francisco for some time
        afterwards. If a business man in a hurry ran into another person—say,
        for example, coming round a corner—the latter would ejaculate,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Hi! are you trying to <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">telescope</span></span>
        a fellow?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The writer will
        not soon forget his ride from Laramie to Sherman, a station on one of
        the ridges of the Rocky Mountains, which the Pacific Railway crosses
        at an altitude of over 8,000 feet. Armed with a pass from the
        company, the courteous station-master at the former place made no
        objection to his accompanying a locomotive with a snow-plough
        attached in front, then starting ahead of the regular train. The
        plough was a rough specimen of its kind, in form not greatly unlike
        the ram of an ironclad, and was constructed of sheet-iron, covering a
        strong wooden frame. But it did its work efficiently, scattering the
        soft snow on either side in waves and spray, reminding one of the
        passage of some great ocean steamship through the billows. The snow
        had drifted in places till it was five or six feet deep on the road,
        but this proved child’s play to the plough, and the services of the
        navvies, who, seated on the coal, were swinging their legs over the
        side of the tender, were not required. The greatest danger on the
        line, now so amply protected by great snow sheds—literally wooden
        tunnels—and snow fences, arises from snow which has thawed, frozen,
        re-thawed, and re-frozen until it is literally packed ice. The wheels
        of a locomotive, arrived at such a point, either revolve helplessly,
        without progressing, or run clean off the metals.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mention of the
        effect of ice on the rails recalls a story told by Colonel Bulkley,
        when the latter was chief of the Russo-American Telegraph Expedition.
        The colonel during the civil war in the States was at the head of a
        constructing party, who built temporary lines of telegraph to follow
        the advancing northern army. The driver of a train which passed
        through the district in which they were engaged had been ordered to
        stop nightly and pick the party up, but one night neglected to do so,
        and the weary constructors had to tramp a dozen miles in the dark to
        the nearest village. The men naturally determined that this should
        not occur again, and so next morning armed themselves with several
        boxes of bar soap. What for? To soap the rails! Colonel Bulkley tells
        gleefully how they rubbed it on for about a quarter of a mile, how
        the train arrived at the place, and after gliding on a certain
        distance, from the momentum it had acquired, came nearly to a
        standstill, and how the men jumped on and told the joke to everybody.
        The engineer next day did not forget to remember them.</p>

        "tei tei-q">“Some writers strongly advise the traveller to make a
        halt at Sherman station,”</span> says Mr. Rae. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The inducements held out to him are mountain scenery,
        invigorating air, fishing and hunting. A sojourn among the peaks of
        the Rocky Mountains has the attraction of novelty to recommend it.
        Life there must be, in every sense of the word, a new sensation. But
        some sensations are undesirable, notwithstanding their undoubted
        freshness. That splendid trout swarm in the streams near Sherman
        admits of no dispute. Yet the disciple of Isaak Walton should not be
        tempted to indulge rashly in his harmless and charming sport. It is
        delightful to hook large fish; but it is less agreeable to be pierced
        through by arrows. Now, the latter contingency is among the
        probabilities which must be taken into consideration. A few weeks
        prior to my journey, one of the conductors of the train by which I
        travelled, learned, by practical experience, that fishing among the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page22">[pg 22]</span><a name="Pg022"
        id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Rocky Mountains has palpable
        and painful drawbacks. Having taken a few days’ holiday, he went
        forth, fishing-rod in hand, to amuse himself. While whipping the
        stream in the innocence of his heart, he was startled to find himself
        made the target for arrows shot by wild Indians. He sought safety in
        flight, and recovered from his wounds, to the surprise as much as to
        the gratification of his friends. His story did not render me
        desirous of sharing his fate.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Great Plains,
        over which the <span class="tei tei-q">“prairie
        schooners”</span><a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href=
        "#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> toil, and
        the trains now fly, have a dreary interest of their own. In summer
        they are hot and dusty, and the contemplation of nearly unlimited
        sage-brush, and the occasional prairie dog or hen, is not enlivening;
        while the constant recurrence of skeletons bleaching in the
        sun—skeletons of overworked mules, horses, and oxen, and sometimes of
        the human animal—is apt to make one melancholy. But on a winter
        moonlight evening, when covered with snow, which has thawed in the
        day, and become <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">glacé</span></span> at night, they resemble one
        vast glittering lake, with the brush-covered hillocks standing for
        islands. The buffaloes, once so common, are rarely or never seen near
        the railway. In that more fertile portion of the plains nearer the
        Missouri, in Nebraska and adjoining states, it is also possible that
        the oft-times grand sight of the prairie on fire may be witnessed
        from the train. The writer was, one evening in May, 1868, in company
        with others, in a Pullman car, when huge massive clouds of smoke
        hanging over the horizon appeared in view. Soon it became evident, as
        the train approached the spot, that the prairie was on fire for
        miles, although fortunately at some distance from the line. The
        flames rose fiercely to the peaceful, starlit sky; the homesteads of
        settlers, trees, and hillocks stood out black against the line of
        destroying fire; while over all a canopy of smoke hung heavily,
        affording a scene not soon to be forgotten.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Westward from the
        high point where Sherman stands, the railway line makes a rapid
        descent to the Laramie Plains, the trains going down, not merely by
        their own weight, but with brakes tightly screwed down. At Dale
        Creek, on this section of the line, a wonderful bridge is crossed. It
        is 650 feet long, and in the centre of the deep ravine it bridges is
        126 feet high. It is built entirely of wood, was erected in thirty
        days, and is a perfect puzzle of trestle-work. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“More than one passenger,”</span> says Mr. Rae,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“who would rather lose a fine sight than risk
        a broken neck, breathes more freely, and gives audible expression to
        his satisfaction, when once the cars have passed in safety over this
        remarkable wooden structure.”</span> Now the train is again
        proceeding rapidly; in twenty miles, the descent of 1,000 feet is
        accomplished. Next, Laramie City is reached, round which is a good
        grazing country. This is succeeded by the plains known as
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The Great American Desert,”</span> another
        barren sage-brush-covered stretch of country. And yet—in addition to
        the fact that even sage-brush is good for something, a decoction of
        it being recommended in cases of ague—the desert has been proved to
        contain its treasures. At Carbon, and other stations on the line,
        fine deposits of coal have been found, and are worked to advantage.
        It was at first feared that all the coal for the railway would have
        to be transported from far distant points.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page23">[pg 23]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the wonders
        of the plains are the huge rocks and bluffs known as the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Buttes,”</span> which often rise from comparatively
        level ground, and in detached spots. Seen in the gloaming, their
        often grotesque forms appear weird and unearthly, and the effect is
        increased by the fact that all around is silent and desolate, and
        their mocking echoes to the snorting iron horse are the only sounds
        that are heard. Some of these rock-masses are columnar, and others
        pyramidal, in form; some assume the shape of heads, human or
        otherwise. Now they rise in huge walls, with as wonderful colouring
        as have the cliffs at Alum Bay in the Isle of Wight; they are often
        several hundred feet in height. One, particularly noted by the
        writer, had almost the exact form of an enormous dog seated on its
        haunches.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the train
        approaches the confines of Mormondom some specially grand scenery is
        met and passed. The stern and rugged ravine known as Echo Cañon<a id=
        "noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> is shut
        in by abrupt and almost perpendicular sandstone and conglomerate
        cliffs, with many a crag standing sentinel-like, and rising high
        towards heaven, over the impetuous, brawling Weber river. Close to
        the Mormon town of Echo there is a cliff 1,000 feet high, which
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">overhangs
        its base</span></span> fifty feet. There is also a rock known as
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The Sphinx of the Valley,”</span> from a
        resemblance to the original. Weber Cañon succeeds the first-named,
        and in this is to be noted a remarkable and nearly perpendicular
        cleft in the cliff—well known as <span class="tei tei-q">“The Devil’s
        Slide.”</span> Further on, and the train arrives at <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The Devil’s Gate,”</span> where the stern rock-walls
        narrow, and the dark hills approach each other closely. Here the
        river becomes a boiling and furious rapid, white with foam, hurrying
        onward with terrible impetuosity, and rolling <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tons</span></span> of
        boulders before its resistless course. Some of the early railway
        bridges were quite washed away by it, and many difficulties were met
        in the construction of the line, heavy tunneling almost obviously
        having been necessary in some places. But all obstacles were
        successfully overcome. Emerging from the gloomy, rugged cañon, the
        more or less fertile and cultivated Weber valley is, by contrast, a
        perfect glimpse of Paradise.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Few travellers,
        however much they may have to hurry, will pass through Utah without a
        flying visit to Salt Lake City, now a very different place from what
        it was when Captain Burton wrote his <span class="tei tei-q">“City of
        the Saints.”</span> The Mormon capital is not on the main line of the
        Pacific Railway, but is connected with it by a short branch of forty
        miles in length. Ogden is the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“junction”</span> for Salt Lake, and has a very tolerable
        station, with dining-rooms, book-stands, and other conveniences. The
        last time the writer passed through this part of Utah in winter, the
        (spirit) thermometer on the platform at Ogden marked −16° Fahr., or
        48° below the freezing-point of water. On the first visit, the branch
        railway was barely commenced, and he proceeded to the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“city”</span> in a <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“mud-waggon,”</span> a kind of packing-case on wheels—for
        he can hardly say on springs—which was driven at a furious rate. How
        many miles he travelled perpendicularly—in jolts—he knows not, but he
        was very tired on arrival at his destination. Yet the journey had
        much of interest in it. There was, for instance, almost all the way
        in sight, and sometimes within a few hundred yards, the Great Salt
        Lake—the Dead Sea of America—whose waters are said to be <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page24">[pg 24]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>one-third salt. This is probably an
        exaggeration, but its shores are white with a mineral efflorescence,
        and it took the Mormons years to irrigate much of the surrounding
        land, and thus literally wash the salty deposits out of it. The fresh
        water for the purpose had to be diverted and brought in hill-side
        ditches, &amp;c., in many cases from a considerable distance. The
        result has repaid them, for the road from Ogden to Utah passes
        through several prosperous towns, and by scores of pleasant
        homesteads embowered in gardens and orchards of peach and apple
        trees, the marks of industrious farm cultivation being everywhere
        apparent.</p><a name="illo_033" id="illo_033" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At one period
        there was some opposition among the Mormons to the construction of
        the trans-continental railway through their territory, as they feared
        that influx of strangers which has actually come to pass. The late
        Brigham Young, however, was either more enlightened, or saw that it
        was no use fighting against the inevitable, and actually took
        contracts to assist in making the railroad, besides afterwards
        building the branch line to the city. It was cleverly said by the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New York
        Herald</span></span> that <span class="tei tei-q">“railway
        communications corrupt good Mormons,”</span> to which President Young
        is stated to have replied that <span class="tei tei-q">“he did not
        care anything for a religion which could not stand a
        railroad.”</span> And in fact, up to a comparatively recent date,
        several thousand fresh recruits, principally from Great Britain and
        the northern nations of Europe, have been conveyed over it
        annually.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is not the
        place for any discussion of the Mormon mystery. It is easy to laugh
        at it, and say with Artemus Ward that, <span class="tei tei-q">“While
        Brigham’s religion was singular, his wives were plural.”</span> The
        fact remains that, in hundreds of cases, Mormons had and have but one
        wife; although, theoretically, they approve of polygamy. The further
        point <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page25">[pg 25]</span><a name=
        "Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>remains that no Mormon
        was allowed to have more than one helpmeet unless he could prove that
        his means were amply sufficient for her support. Industry was the
        keystone of Brigham Young’s teachings, however otherwise mixed with
        fanaticism and superstition, and the result has been that thousands
        of people, mostly poor, who settled in an unpromising-looking
        country, have now homes and farms of their own, and that by sheer
        hard work the desert has been made literally <span class=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Salt Lake City has
        been laid out with care, and the streets are wide and well kept;
        while, excepting those of a small business centre, every house has a
        very large garden attached. The days of the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“avenging angels,”</span> or Danites, is over, and every
        man’s life and property are nowadays safe there, although at one time
        many suspected or obnoxious persons were, as our American cousins
        say, <span class="tei tei-q">“found missing.”</span> On one terrible
        occasion—the Mountain Meadow massacre—a whole train of emigrants who,
        on their way to California, had encamped near the city, were murdered
        by Indians, whom, there is no doubt, the Mormons had incited to the
        deed. A dignitary of the Mormon Church, Bishop Lee, suffered the
        death-penalty at the hands of the United States authorities for his
        share in the transaction. The emigrants, then passing with their
        families by the hundred, had, there is no doubt, much aggravated the
        Mormons by jeering and mockery, and sometimes by purloining their
        cattle and goods. There has been for many years a garrison of United
        States troops kept at Camp Douglas, a short distance from Salt Lake
        City, for the protection of Gentiles,<a id="noteref_10" name=
        "noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a> and the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the best
        features of this strange community is the marked absence of
        drunkenness and profligacy. Most Mormons are teetotallers, and drink
        little more than tea or coffee, or the crystal water which runs in
        deep brooks through every street, and has its birth in the heights of
        the beautiful snow-clad Wahsatch Mountains, which are a great feature
        in the scenery of Salt Lake Valley. Salt Lake City has a remarkable
        building, known by the faithful as <span class="tei tei-q">“The
        Tabernacle,”</span> and by the irreverent as the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Big Egg-shell,”</span> from the oval form of its roof.
        It holds 8,000 persons, or, under pressure, even more. It has an
        organ in point of size the second in America. The writer attended a
        service there, given in honour of some missionary Mormons who were
        about to part for Europe. The Salt Lake theatre is another feature of
        the place, and has a good company of Mormon amateur actors and
        actresses. We once saw there some twenty-five of Brigham Young’s
        family in the front rows of the pit. Formerly, it is said, payment at
        the doors was taken <span class="tei tei-q">“in kind,”</span> and a
        Mormon would deposit at the box-office a ham, a plump sucking-pig—not
        alive—a bag of dried peaches, or a dozen mop-handles, maybe, for his
        seats!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Taking a last
        glimpse of the great Salt Lake, passing Corinne, where, when it was
        only six weeks old, a bank and a newspaper office, both in tents, had
        been established, the train proceeds through a more or less barren
        district on its way to Nevada, the Silver State, a country where, for
        the most part, life is only endurable when one is making money
        rapidly. Those who would see some of the silver mines with
        comparative ease <span class="tei tei-q">“get off”</span> the train
        at Reno, thence proceeding by branch rail to Virginia City and Gold
        Hill, places where that form of mining life may be studied to
        perfection. So great has been the yield of the Nevada and other
        silver mines of adjoining territories, that, as most of us know, the
        value of silver has actually depreciated. Some of the millionaires of
        San Francisco gained their wealth in Nevada.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the United
        States the distances between leading places is so great that the
        fares charged, albeit generally moderate, cannot suit slender purses,
        while empty pockets are nowhere. In consequence many attempt to
        smuggle themselves through. The writer remembers, in about the part
        of the route under notice, a <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“dead-head”</span> who had for several stations managed
        to elude the notice of the guard, but who was at last detected, and
        put off at a point a dozen or more miles from the nearest settlement.
        The <span class="tei tei-q">“dead-head,”</span> like the stowaway on
        board ship, of whom as many as fourteen have been concealed on a
        single vessel, and not one of them discovered by the proper
        authorities till far out at sea, is an unrecognised institution on
        the railways of the United States. Perhaps because our ticket system
        is more rigidly enforced, few attempt to take a free passage on
        English railways, although it is stated that a sailor was found, some
        little time since, asleep <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">under</span></span> a carriage, his arms and
        legs coiled round the brake-rods, having succeeded in nearly making
        the trip from London to Liverpool undiscovered. But, then, sailors
        are hardened to jars and shocks and noises, by being accustomed to
        the warring of the elements and so forth. The reader may remember
        that when, some few years ago, a Great Western train intersected and
        completely cut in two another which crossed its path, a sailor was
        found asleep on the seat of a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">half</span></span> third-class carriage, and
        that he was quite angry <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page27">[pg
        27]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>when
        awoke and told of his narrow escape. All this bears a strong
        resemblance to digression, so let us return to our
        subject—<span class="tei tei-q">“dead heads.”</span> Examples of this
        tribe have boasted that they have travelled all over the States for
        nothing. Good-natured guards—always <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“conductors”</span> in America—will often wink at his
        presence, but more rigid officials have been known to stop the train
        outside a long tunnel, or on one side of a dangerous open
        trestle-work bridge, and peremptorily tell the vagrant to
        <span class="tei tei-q">“get!”</span> He has often worked his way
        clear across the American continent. Turned off one train, kicked off
        another, left in the snow half-way between far distant stations,
        charitably allowed a short ride on an open freight car, walking where
        he may not ride, stealing where it is easier than begging, and
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice
        versâ</span></span>, he has at last arrived in California, where, to
        do a glorious country and a generous people justice, not even a tramp
        is allowed to starve. After all, does not the vagabond deserve
        something for his enterprise? Perhaps in that land, now far more of
        corn and hops and wine than of gold, he may, under more auspicious
        circumstances, become a better and more prosperous man.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Few tourists or
        travellers of leisure will fail to pay a flying visit to the grand
        and beautiful lakes and tarns lying among the eternal snows of the
        Sierra Nevada mountains, which separate the Silver from the Golden
        State, and are crossed by the Pacific Railway at an elevation of
        7,042 feet above the sea level. From the Summit and Truckee stations
        there are all necessary facilities for reaching Donner, Tahoe, and
        other lakes, and for a stay among some of the grandest scenery in the
        world. The space occupied by this chapter would not describe in the
        barest details the grand mountain peaks, in one case rising to an
        altitude of 14,500 feet; the forests of magnificent trees; the
        quieter valleys <span class="tei tei-q">“in verdure clad;”</span> the
        waterfalls and cataracts and torrents of this Alpine region, which is
        within half a day’s journey of San Francisco, and but three or four
        hours from districts which for eight months of the year have the
        temperature of Southern Italy. Sufficiently good coaches convey you
        to leading points, where there are comfortable inns, or, in the
        summer months, travellers can do a little tent-life and open-air
        camping with advantage, the climate among the mountains being pure,
        bracing, and yet warm. On the leading lakes there are boats to be
        had, and on one or two there are small steamers plying regularly.
        Fishing and hunting can be indulged in to the heart’s content. The
        Sierra mountain trout is unsurpassed anywhere; while the sportsman
        can bag anything from a Californian quail to a grizzly bear—the
        latter, more especially, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">if he can</span></span>. At most of the ordinary
        places of resort he will get the morning papers of San Francisco the
        same day, while Truckee boasts of a journal of its own, published, be
        it observed, 7,000 feet up the mountains!<a id="noteref_11" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the
        writer’s recollections of the Sierra region is not so pleasant, but
        then it was under its winter aspect. He had been warned on leaving
        San Francisco that the railway might be <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“snowed up,”</span> as it was in 1871-2, when for several
        weeks there was a blockade, and he was recommended to go to New York
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">viâ</span></span> Panama. That voyage he had
        once made, and, besides, had a desire to see the continent in winter,
        when the journey <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page28">[pg
        28]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>from
        the Sierra Nevada Mountains to New York is made through 3,000 miles
        of snow. So he started, and for twelve hours or so all went well; but
        at the very <span class="tei tei-q">“summit”</span> of the railway
        line, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, its highest point among the
        Sierra Nevada, and near the station of the same name, the train came
        suddenly to a standstill in the gloom of a long <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“snow-shed”</span> tunnel. Worse, as it seemed to some,
        the engine deserted it, and ran away, while the conductor was also
        absent for a long time. The carriages were not too well lighted,
        although quite warm enough, thanks to the glowing stoves, while
        memories of former blockades and half-starved passengers did not aid
        in reassuring the frozen-in travellers. Few slept that night, and,
        indeed, in one carriage, where there were several squalling babies
        and scolding females, it would have been difficult. Some of the older
        travellers, who had something of Mark Tapleyism about them, did their
        best to cheer the rest, and passed their wicker-covered
        demijohns—flasks are hardly enough for a seven days’ journey, which
        might be indefinitely extended—to those who had not provided
        themselves; one individual did his best to relieve the monotony with
        a song; but it fell rather flat, and melancholy reigned
        supreme.<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href=
        "#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> But not
        for long. About seven next morning there was a commotion; a whistle
        in the distance; another nearer, which, hoarse as it was, sounded
        like heavenly music; and in a few minutes the good locomotive
        arrived, coupled with the train, and took it to the nearest station,
        where breakfast was ready for all who would partake. And that
        breakfast! Trout, chicken, venison, hot bread, buckwheat cakes, and
        molasses, and all the usual, and some other of the unusual, adjuncts
        of a regular American meal. The traveller must not expect all these
        luxuries at places nearer the centre of the continent, where, in some
        cases, all that you will get are beans and bacon, hot bread, tea or
        coffee, and perhaps stewed (dried) apples or peaches. At such places
        the excuse is sufficient, for everything is brought from a
        considerable distance, while the stations themselves have only been
        erected for the railway, and sometimes do not boast a single dwelling
        other than those immediately connected with it.</p><a name="illo_038"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And so we descend,
        first to the foot-hills, and then to the plains of sunny California.
        Evidences of mining, past and present, are to be often seen: flumes
        and ditches through which the water is rushing rapidly, old shafts,
        and works, and mills, and boarding-houses. But the glory is departed,
        or rather changed for the more permanent vineyard and grain-field and
        orchard. Some of the finest wines and fruits are raised among these
        said foot-hills. And now we cross the American river, and are in
        Sacramento, the legislative capital of the State, a city surrounded
        by pleasant suburbs, handsome villas, and splendid mansions. Thence
        to San Francisco there is the choice of a ride on the Sacramento
        River to the Bay, or one of two railways—once so near the Bay City,
        few care to delay, and so press on. The railway bears you through a
        highly-cultivated country to Oakland, the Brooklyn of San Francisco,
        and place of residence for many of its merchant princes. Here all the
        year round flowers are in full bloom. When leaving California in
        winter we noted roses, daisies, verbenas, pansies, violets,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page29">[pg 29]</span><a name="Pg029"
        id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>hollyhocks, calla lillies, and
        camellias, all growing in the open-air. This is not particularly
        surprising, for in our own country, in Devonshire and Cornwall,
        particularly at Penzance, a modified statement of the same nature
        might be made. At Oakland the railway runs out on a wooden pier or
        bridge, one mile and a quarter long, to the bay.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of San Francisco
        and its glorious bay these pages have already furnished some account.
        It is the grand depôt for all that concerns commerce and travel
        between every part of America and much of Europe and the Pacific
        generally. The successful miner, trader, or farmer, from Nevada,
        Oregon, Colorado, and all outlying territories, spends his money
        there; as the metropolis of the coast-trade of all kind <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">centres</span></span>
        there. Hence its success and cosmopolitan character.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In speaking of the
        cosmopolitan characteristics of the Golden City, a traveller (Mr.
        Carlisle), says that one of the good points, coming, as did he, from
        the remoteness of Japan, is the proximity of the city to Europe as
        regards the receipt of news.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The city of San Francisco is eight hours behind London
        in the matter of time, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page30">[pg
        30]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and
        one turns this to good advantage. When her corn-merchants go down to
        their offices in the morning they find on their desks a report of the
        Liverpool market of that morning; each morning paper has two or three
        columns filled with telegrams of the preceding evening from all parts
        of Europe, and not unfrequently there appears among these telegrams a
        notice of the following kind:—<span class="tei tei-q">‘The
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Times</span></span> of to-day has an article in
        which it says,’</span> &amp;c., &amp;c., giving the substance of that
        morning’s leader.”</span> The present writer can illustrate this
        point by an actual occurrence in his own experience. Every reader
        will remember the terrible explosion in the Regent’s Park, which did
        so much damage, and which happened about half-past three in the
        morning. He was then occupying the post of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“telegraphic editor,”</span> &amp;c., on the staff of the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alta
        California</span></span>, the oldest journal published on that coast.
        The news of the explosion reached him by telegram at 11.30 the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">evening
        before</span></span>, that is, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">apparently</span></span>, before it happened!
        The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Alta</span></span> therefore was able to give
        the sad intelligence to all its readers—some few of them as early as
        four o’clock—the next morning, while the London newspapers of the
        early editions could naturally have nothing about it, as they were
        printed before its occurrence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. W. F. Rae, a
        writer before quoted in regard to the character which the city
        unfortunately acquired in early days, says of it:—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“From being a bye-word for its lawlessness and
        licentiousness, the city of San Francisco has become in little more
        than ten years as moral as Philadelphia, and far more orderly than
        New York.”</span> The fact is that one must obtain a <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“permit”</span> to carry a revolver at all, and that
        permission cannot properly be obtained by anyone of dissipated or
        dangerous character. A heavy fine is inflicted on any one wearing a
        pistol without having secured the necessary authority. The same
        writer says:—<span class="tei tei-q">“That the Golden State is of
        extraordinary richness is well known to every traveller. To some, as
        to me, it may have been a matter of rejoicing to discover that
        California is also a land teeming with unexpected natural beauties
        and rare natural delights.”</span> He quotes approvingly
        Lieutenant-Governor Holden’s speech at a festive meeting held in
        Sacramento, California, on the completion of the Pacific Railway.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Why, sir,”</span> said the
        Lieutenant-Governor, a gentleman who had himself done much towards
        the successful consummation of that grand enterprise, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“we have the bravest men, the handsomest women, and the
        fattest babies of any place under the canopy of heaven!”</span> Baron
        Hübner, in his published work,<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13"
        href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a> says of
        the climate, <span class="tei tei-q">“It is a perpetual
        spring;”</span> and then, alluding to the decreased yield of gold,
        remarks truly, <span class="tei tei-q">“Its real riches lie in the
        fertility of the soil.”</span> And once more, Margharita Weppner, the
        German lady-traveller before mentioned, says, speaking of a
        fruit-show she visited:—<span class="tei tei-q">“What I saw there
        could only be found in California, for I have never seen anything to
        equal it, even in the tropics.”</span> She adds,
        enthusiastically:—<span class="tei tei-q">“This beautiful city of the
        golden land I prefer to any other in America. My preference is due to
        the agreeable kind of life which its people lead, and to the
        extraordinary salubrity of the climate.”</span> The present writer
        has preferred to collate from these independent sources rather than
        from his own long experience; but he can testify to the truth of
        every one of the above statements. One of the grandest features in
        San Francisco’s present <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page31">[pg
        31]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and
        assured future success is the fact that the steamship companies of
        the whole Pacific make it their leading port.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From San Francisco
        the traveller bent on seeing the world can proceed to New Zealand and
        Australia, calling at Honolulu in the Hawaïan Islands, and Fiji, on
        the way; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">or</span></span> he can make his way to China,
        calling at Japan, in steamships having perhaps the most roomy
        accommodation in the world; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">or</span></span> he can reach Panama and South
        American ports, calling at Mexican ports <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">en route</span></span>,
        by steamships which pass over the most pacific part of the Pacific
        Ocean; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">or</span></span>, again, he can make delightful
        trips northwards to Californian and Oregonian and British Columbian
        ports; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">or</span></span>, once again, southwards to
        ports of Southern California. These lines are running constantly, and

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A very ordinary
        trip now-a-days for those rounding the world is that from San
        Francisco to China, calling at Japan on the way. The steamships of
        the Pacific Mail Company are those principally employed, and a voyage
        on such a vessel as the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">China</span></span>, which is one of the crack
        vessels of the service, is one almost invariably of pleasure. The
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">China</span></span> is a steamship of over 4,000
        tons, and cost 800,000 dollars, or, roughly, £160,000 sterling. She
        will often carry 2,000 tons of tea on a return voyage, to say nothing
        of perhaps from five to fifteen hundred Chinamen. A traveller<a id=
        "noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a> already
        referred to states, that with only 580 on board half a ton of rice
        had to be served out daily, with a modicum of meat and vegetables.
        One of the leading cargoes on the outward trip from San Francisco is
        corpses and coffins, few Chinamen being ever buried out of their
        native land. In the splendid and roomy saloons of these steamers
        there are always Chinese waiters, who are said to be most obliging,
        and noiseless in their motions. Negro waiters are civil and assiduous
        enough in their attendance, but are always fussy; in this respect
        <span class="tei tei-q">“John”</span> is a great improvement on
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Sambo.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“An additional proof,”</span> said a leading journal
        <span class="tei tei-q">“of the new vitality infused into that long
        inert mass, the Chinese Empire, has just been supplied from San
        Francisco,”</span> and the writer goes on to describe a new
        development of their mercantile enterprise. It seems that there has
        been in existence for some time past an association termed the
        Chinese Merchants’ Steamship Company, the stockholders of which are
        wealthy <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page32">[pg 32]</span><a name=
        "Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>native merchants and
        mandarins, who own many coasting steamers. The company is now about
        to start a line from China to the Sandwich Islands and San Francisco,
        and it is not improbable that the Chinese emigrants may prefer these
        steamers to any other. The manager of this Celestial <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“P. and O.”</span> is one Tong Ken Sing, a shrewd native
        of Singapore; and, continues the writer, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“under the enlightened control of this man of his epoch,
        who is equally at home with tails and taels, the company is sure to
        succeed.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After leaving the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Golden Gate,”</span> the entrance to the Bay
        of San Francisco, and passing the rocky Farralones, islands whence a
        company brings a million of sea-birds’ eggs to the city yearly, the
        voyager by this route will not see land till Japan is reached. The
        steamships stop nowhere <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">en route</span></span>. The passengers must
        depend on their own resources aboard for amusement, and every passing
        sail becomes an object of greatest interest. Yet still there is
        always the sea itself, in its varying aspects of placid or turbulent
        grandeur. <span class="tei tei-q">“The appearance of the open
        sea,”</span> says Frédol, <span class="tei tei-q">“far from the
        shore—the boundless ocean—is to the man who loves to create a world
        of his own, in which he can freely exercise his thoughts, filled with
        sublime ideas of the Infinite. His searching eye rests upon the
        far-distant horizon; he sees there the ocean and the heavens meeting
        in a vapoury outline, where the stars ascend and descend, appear and
        disappear in their turn. Presently this everlasting change in nature
        awakens in him a vague feeling of that sadness <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘which,’</span> says Humboldt, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘lies at the root of all our heartfelt
        joys.’</span> ”</span> When the Breton fisherman or mariner puts to
        sea, his touching prayer is, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Keep me, my God! my
        boat is so small, and Thy ocean so wide!</span></span>”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“We find in the sea,”</span> says Lacepède,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“unity and diversity, which constitute its
        beauty; grandeur and simplicity, which give it sublimity; puissance
        and immensity, which command our wonder.”</span> That immense expanse
        of water is no mere liquid desert; it teems with life, however little
        that life may be visible. The inhabitants of the water through which
        the good ship ploughs her way are as numerous as those of the solid
        earth; although, unless the great sea-serpent makes its fitful
        appearance, the experience of a traveller over the Pacific by this
        route will be repeated. Says he:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Few signs of life are visible outside the vessel.
        Occasionally a whale is reported in sight, but for many days most of
        the passengers are inclined to think it is only something very
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘like one,’</span> till, as the days pass,
        every person has caught a glimpse of a spout of water suddenly
        shooting up from the sea without any apparent reason, or of a black
        line cutting through the blue surface for a moment, and then
        disappearing to unknown depths. Occasionally, too, one or more
        sea-birds are seen following in the vessel’s wake, sweeping
        gracefully across and again across the white band of foam, and with
        difficulty keeping down their natural pace to that of the
        steam-driven monster. These birds are of two kinds only: the
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Mother Carey’s Chicken,’</span> and another,
        called by the sailors the <span class="tei tei-q">‘Cape Hen’</span>—a
        brown bird, rather larger and longer in the wing than a sea-gull.
        Both birds are visible when we are in mid-ocean, 1,000 miles at least
        from the nearest dry land.”</span> The writer of these pages has seen
        whales, in the North Pacific, keep up with the vessel on which he was
        a passenger for half an hour or more together. On one occasion a
        large whale was swimming abreast of the steamer so closely that rifle
        and pistol shots were fired at it, some undoubtedly hitting their
        mark, yet the great <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page33">[pg
        33]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>mammal did not show the slightest symptoms of
        even temporary annoyance, and there is reason to believe was not much
        more hurt by the shots than would the targets at Wimbledon be
        affected by a shower of peas.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Occasionally a
        little diversity and profit are got out of passengers by the sailors
        when they go for the first time on the fo’castle. The latter draw on
        the deck a chalk line quickly round the former, and each visitor so
        <span class="tei tei-q">“chalked,”</span> as it is called, must pay a
        fine in the shape of a bottle of rum. This secures one, however, the
        freedom of the ship ever after.</p><a name="illo_042" id="illo_042"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the deck
        games popular on long voyages is a form of quoits, played with rings
        and chalked spaces, or, in some cases, on a spike driven into the
        deck. A traveller<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href=
        "#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a> gives an
        amusing account of a cricket club formed on the vessel in which he
        was a passenger. Fancy playing cricket at sea! He says:—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Lord Warden</span></span> cricket-ground is on
        the main deck, and, owing to the somewhat limited space at the
        disposal of the ten members, single-wicket matches are the invariable
        rule. The stumps, which are fixed in a frame so as to remain steady
        on the deck, are about two feet in height, and of course bails are
        provided, but never used. Of bats the club boasts not a few, of
        varied construction. Of these the majority are fashioned out of a
        thick deal plank, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page34">[pg
        34]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>soon
        go to pieces; but one of elm, which was christened off Cape de Verde,
        survived many weeks of hard usage, and was more precious to the club
        than the most expensive of Cobbett’s productions. It was fully
        intended by a member of the Marylebone Club to obtain for this tough
        little piece of elm a final resting-place in the Pavilion at Lord’s,
        but unfortunately the <span class="tei tei-q">‘leviathan
        hitter,’</span> in attempting a huge drive, let it slip out of his
        hands, and it is lost to us for ever.”</span> The boatswain furnished
        spun-yarn balls at sixpence each, but these seldom had a long life,
        four or five being frequently hit overboard in the course of an
        afternoon’s play; nearly 300 were exhausted on the voyage.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The wicket,”</span> continues the narrator,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“is pitched just in front of the weather
        poop-ladder, the bowling-crease being thirteen yards further forward,
        by the side of the deck-house. Behind the bowler stands an out-field,
        while mid-on or mid-off, according to which tack the ship is on, has
        his back to the midshipmen’s berth, and has also occasionally to
        climb over the boom-board above it, and search for a lost ball among
        a chaos of boats and spare spars.... Run-getting on board ship is a
        matter of difficulty, the ball having the supremacy over the bat,
        which is exactly reversed on shore. A cricketer who thinks but little
        of the side-hill at Lord’s would find himself thoroughly non-plussed
        by the incline of a ship’s deck in a stiff breeze. A good eye and
        hard straight driving effected much, but a steady defence and the
        scientific <span class="tei tei-q">‘placing’</span> of the ball under
        the winch often succeeded equally well, especially on a wet wicket.
        The highest score of the season was eighteen, which included two hits
        on to the forecastle, feats of very rare occurrence.”</span> The
        games were highly popular, and were watched by appreciative
        assemblages of the passengers. On the same vessel a glee club was
        organised, and an evening in Christmas week was devoted to
        theatricals, by the <span class="tei tei-q">“Shooting Stars of the
        Southern Seas.”</span> Dancing is common enough on board, and, of
        course, is often pursued under difficulties; a sudden lurch of the
        ship may throw a number of couples off their feet or tumble them in a
        chaotic heap.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another
        traveller<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href=
        "#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a> gives us
        some amusing notes on the private theatricals performed on board the
        famous old steamship <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Great Britain</span></span>. He was stage
        manager, and says:—<span class="tei tei-q">“I had a great deal to do,
        as I was responsible for dresses, and had to see that everybody was
        ready. I had among other things to procure a chignon. I was in a
        dilemma, as I did not like to ask a lady for the loan of one, even
        where no doubt existed as to her wearing false hair; so at last I
        procured some oakum from the carpenter, and made three large
        sausages, and it was pronounced a success. The stage is erected in
        the saloon, and we had footlights, with a gorgeous screen of flags,
        &amp;c.”</span> Special prologues were written for these
        entertainments, one of which, on the occasion of performing the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Taming of a Tiger”</span> and the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Area Belle,”</span> ran as follows:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then came mention

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">and so forth. The
        performance took place while the vessel was constantly rolling. Mr.
        Laird says that he had to think almost as much of his equilibrium as
        of anything else; but as he had always to appear trembling before the
        presence of his master in the piece, it did pretty well, except in
        one lurch, when he went flying in an undignified manner across the
        stage into the arms of the prompter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On another
        occasion an entertainment, entitled <span class="tei tei-q">“Mrs.
        Jarley’s Waxworks,”</span> was presented. Five children were dressed
        up to represent different characters, and pretence was made of
        winding them up to make them go. The best was a cannibal, converted
        to be a missionary; another personated Fair Rosamond; and a third the
        Marquis of Lorne. The missionary handed tracts about, and Queen
        Eleanor alternately presented a dagger and a cup of cold poison to
        Fair Rosamond. A regularly-organised concert followed, while a farce
        and spoken epilogue concluded this, the last performance on board the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baron Hübner has
        given us, in his published work before quoted, some interesting
        reminiscences of, and graphic notes on, his voyage to Japan from San
        Francisco. A few extracts may be permitted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">July 4.</span></span>—The sky is pearly grey.
        The vessel is all painted white: masts, deck-cabins, deck,
        tarpaulins, benches—all are white. This deck, from poop to prow, is
        all in one piece, and makes a famous walk. Almost all the morning I
        am alone there. The first-class passengers get up very late; the
        second-class—that is, the Chinese—not at all. <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page36">[pg 36]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>They go to bed at San Francisco, and never
        leave their berths till they reach their destination. You never see
        one of them on deck. The sailors, having done their duty, disappear
        likewise. And how easy that duty is in such weather! On leaving the
        Golden Gate the sails were hoisted, and have remained untouched ever
        since. The breeze is just strong enough to fill them and keep us
        steady. The result is a complete calm. The smoke ascends up to heaven
        in a straight line. So the sailors have a fine time of it. They
        sleep, smoke, or play down-stairs with their companions. The two men
        at the helm—these two are Americans—are equally invisible, for a
        watch-tower hides them from sight, as well as the rudder and the
        officer of the watch. I have thus got the deck of this immense ship
        entirely to myself. I pace it from one end to the other, four hundred
        feet backwards and forwards. The only impediment is a transverse bar
        of iron, as high as one’s head, which binds in the middle the two
        sides of the ship. It is painted white, like all the rest, and is
        difficult to see. In every position in life there is always the worm
        in the bud or thorn in the flesh—or, at any rate, some dark spot. On
        board the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">China</span></span> the dark spot for me is that
        detestable white bar. Not only am I perpetually knocking <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page37">[pg 37]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>my head against it, but it reminds me
        unpleasantly of the frailty of human things. It is very thin, and
        yet, if I am to believe the engineer, it is this bar alone which, in
        very bad weather, prevents the enormous shell of the boat from
        breaking in half. There are moments when one’s life hangs on a
        thread; here it hangs on an iron bar. That is better, perhaps, but it
        is not enough.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fine vessels
        of the company then running were, although perhaps the most
        commodious in the world, hardly the safest. The distance between San
        Francisco and Japan is 5,000 miles, and, barring a few hundred miles
        on the coasts of the latter, the ocean is almost one grand calm lake.
        But cyclones occur in the Japanese seas when the high-built American
        boats are not safe.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baron Hübner gives
        us some notes on the passengers on board, which included nine
        nationalities. Among them was a dignified and venerable Parsee
        merchant, a merchant prince in his way, who had wished to study
        European manners, and so had proceeded as far as San Francisco. What
        he saw there impressed him so unfavourably, that he immediately took
        passage back again. What he observed, indeed, filled him with
        disgust. <span class="tei tei-q">“The men,”</span> said he,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“what a lack of dignity! Never in the streets
        of our towns will you be shocked by the sight of drunkards and bad
        women.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hübner gives also
        some sketches of the officers on board. The chief engineer is
        described as a thoughtful and meditative man—a Roman Catholic, deeply
        imbued with the spirit of religious fervour, and spending his time in
        the alternate study of theology and practical mechanics. His cabin,
        opening on the one side to the deck and on the other to the
        machinery, contained a well-selected, though small, library of
        scientific and classical books, and was adorned by pots of flowers,
        which he managed to keep alive by constant care, in spite of the
        sea-breezes, for they had been given to him by his young and
        beautiful wife, whose portrait hung upon the wall. For a couple of
        weeks only in each three months could he see his better half.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Baron
        describes the waiters on board as follows:—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The head waiter is a native of Hamburg. He and his white
        comrade lead an easy life; they confine their labours to overlooking
        the Chinese men, and pass the rest of their time in flirting with the
        ladies’-maids. These are the only two idlers in the service.
        Thirty-two Chinamen do the duties of waiters on the passengers and at
        table. Although short, they look well enough with their black caps,
        their equally black pig-tails, which go down to their heels, their
        dark-<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page38">[pg 38]</span><a name=
        "Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>blue tunics, their
        large white trousers, their gaiters or white stockings, and their
        black felt shoes with strong white soles. They form themselves into
        symmetrical groups, and do everything with method. Fancy a huge
        cabin, in which the small table of twenty-two guests is lost, with
        all these little Chinamen fluttering round them and serving them in
        the most respectful manner, without making any noise. The Hamburg
        chief, idly leaning against a console, with one hand in his trousers’
        pocket, directs with the forefinger of the other the evolutions of
        his docile squadron.”</span> The daily inspection, common on all
        well-regulated passenger ships, is thus described:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">July 6.</span></span>—Every day, at eleven
        o’clock in the morning and at eight o’clock in the evening, the
        captain, followed by the purser, makes the rounds of the ship. In
        that of the morning all the cabin-doors are opened, only excepting
        those of the ladies; but the moment these have gone out <a name=
        "corr038" id="corr038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class=
        "tei tei-corr">the</span> captain visits them with equal care. If any
        matches are discovered they are pitilessly confiscated. This morning
        the captain invited me to accompany him, and I could convince myself
        with my own eyes of the perfect order and discipline which reign
        everywhere. Nothing was more tempting than that department which one
        greatly avoids, the kitchens. The head cook and his assistants, all
        Germans, did the honours of their domain. Every man was at his post,
        and only anxious to show the visitors the most secret corners of his
        department. It was like an examination of conscience carefully made.
        The provision and store-rooms were admirable. Everything was of the
        first and best quality; everything was in abundance; everything was
        classed and ticketed like the drugs in a chemist’s shop. The Chinese
        quarter is on the lower deck. We have about 800 on board. They are
        all in their berths, smoking and talking, and enjoying the rare
        pleasure in their lives of being able to spend five weeks in complete
        idleness. In spite of the great number of men penned into so
        comparatively small a space, the ventilation is so well managed that
        there is neither closeness nor bad smells. The captain inspects every
        hole and corner, literally everything—and everywhere we found the
        same extraordinary cleanliness. One small space is reserved for the
        opium-eaters or smokers; and we saw these victims of a fatal habit,
        some eagerly inhaling the poison, others already feeling its effects.
        Lying on their backs and fast asleep, their deadly-pale features gave
        them the look of corpses.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A common
        occurrence, but always of great interest to the passengers, is thus
        described:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">July 7.</span></span>—Contrary to our usual
        sleepy habits, we are all to-day in a state of excitement and
        agitation. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">China</span></span> is to come to the point
        where it ought to meet the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">America</span></span>, which was to leave
        Hong-Kong five-and-twenty days ago. Our top-sails are filled with
        little Chinamen, whose eager eyes are fixed on the horizon. The
        captain and officers are standing close to the bowsprit, their
        telescopes pointed in the same direction. Even my Spanish friend has
        left his engine, his flower-pots, and his wife’s portrait, to gaze at
        the blue sea, slightly rippled, but, as usual, without a speck of a
        sail. No <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">America</span></span>! The captain’s heart is in
        his shoes. He consults his charts, his instruments, his officers, all
        in vain. The day passes without the steamer being signalled. The
        dinner is silent and sad. Every one seems preoccupied, and the
        captain is evidently anxious. It seems that the directors of the
        company make a point of their two boats meeting. It is <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page39">[pg 39]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to them a proof that their captains have
        followed a straight course, and that the San Francisco boat has
        crossed, without any accident, a third of the Pacific. The passengers
        gladly avail themselves of this precious opportunity to write to
        their friends. For the captains themselves it is a question of
        honour. They like to show their skill in this way, and their
        cleverness in being able, despite the variable and
        imperfectly-understood currents of the Pacific, to make a straight
        course across this enormous sheet of water.</span></p>

        sight!’</span> I throw on my clothes and tumble on deck. The morning
        is beautiful, and this colossal steamer, the largest after the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Great
        Eastern</span></span>, draws near majestically. The usual salutes are
        exchanged, and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">America’s</span></span> gig brings us an extract
        from their log, the list of the passengers, the newspapers from
        Hong-Kong, Shanghai, and Yokohama, and, which is essential, takes
        charge of our letters for America and Europe. A few moments after she
        resumes her course. What a grand and imposing sight! At six o’clock
        she has already disappeared behind the horizon. At the moment of
        meeting we had run exactly 1,500 miles—that is, half the distance
        between England and New York.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">China</span></span>
        encountered a cyclone, or rather the outer edge of one, which is
        graphically described by Hübner. He says:—<span class="tei tei-q">“At
        this moment the ocean was really magnificent. In the boiling sea the
        foam was driven horizontally towards the east. The water was
        positively inky, with here and there whitish gleams of light. The sky
        was iron-grey; to the west a curtain of the same colour, but darker.
        The thermometer was still falling rapidly. In the air above the waves
        I suddenly saw a cloud of white flakes; they were little bits of Joss
        paper which the Chinese were throwing into the sea to appease their
        gods. I passed before the open door of the engineer; he was watering
        his plants. The passengers were all gathered together in the saloon.
        Some of them were moved almost to tears. At twelve o’clock the sky
        cleared a little, and the faces brightened considerably. I have often
        remarked that people when in danger, whether real or imaginary, are
        like children; the slightest thing will make them laugh or cry. The
        Bombay master-baker, the Chinese merchant, and the two Japanese,
        struck me by their imperturbability. The first whispered in my ear,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘The company is very unwise to have a Chinese
        crew; the Malays are much better. Chinese sailors are scared at the
        least danger, and would be the first to make off in the
        lifeboats.’</span> Fung-Tang has an equally bad opinion of his
        fellow-countrymen. He says to me, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Chinese
        good men, very good; bad sailors, very bad!’</span> I reply,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘If we go to the bottom, what will become of
        Fung-Tang?’</span> He replies, <span class="tei tei-q">‘If good,
        place above; if bad, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">below stairs</span></span>,
        punished.’</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        night the ocean suddenly calmed. The <span class=

        has got out of the region of the cyclone. The weather is delicious;
        the sea like glass. But at <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page40">[pg
        40]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>four
        o’clock in the afternoon we suddenly find ourselves amidst colossal
        waves; and yet there is not a breath of wind. They tell us that this
        was probably yesterday the centre of the typhoon. It has exhausted
        itself or gone elsewhere; but the sea which it lashed into fury is
        still agitated, like the pulse of a fever patient after the fit is
        over.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yokohama, whose
        very name signifies <span class="tei tei-q">“across the sea and
        shore,”</span> has been before briefly described in these pages.
        Travellers have given some interesting accounts of it, and as in a
        tour round the world it would form one of the leading
        stopping-places, some further allusion to it may be permitted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Baron Hübner says
        in effect that at every step one takes there one asks if it be not
        all a dream, a fairy tale, a story of the thousand-and-one nights.
        Arriving there from San Francisco, the step from American to Oriental
        civilisation is particularly noticed. The Baron refers particularly
        to the courtesy and extreme cleanliness of the people. Even the
        coolies, bearing great cases or baskets slung on bamboos resting on
        their athletic shoulders, stop to chatter and laugh so pleasantly
        that labour seems to have lost half its curse. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Misery,”</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“is
        unknown amongst them; so also is luxury.”</span> If the Japanese have
        arrived at this happy mean it would be a great pity to disturb their
        peaceful condition by the introduction of a so-called civilisation,
        and its attendant expenses and new wants.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What adds to the charm of the scene,”</span> says the
        same authority, <span class="tei tei-q">“is the smiling look of the
        country, and the intense beauty, at this season (summer), of the
        setting sun. The sky is positively crimson, with great clouds of
        Sèvres blue; the long promontory of Thanagawa is inundated with
        mother-of-pearl; and on the purpled violet sea the pale shadows of
        the ships and junks stand out against the sky, the one rocked by the
        swell, the others gliding across the water like phantoms.”</span> The
        winter in Japan is cold enough, as Mrs. Brassey discovered;<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mrs. Brassey gives
        some life-like pictures from Yokohama.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Having landed,”</span> says she, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“we went with the Consul to the native town to see the
        curio shops, which are a speciality of the place. The inhabitants are
        wonderfully clever at making all sorts of curiosities, and the
        manufactories of so called <span class="tei tei-q">‘antique
        bronzes’</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">‘old china’</span> are
        two of the most wonderful sights in Yokohama. The way in which they
        scrape, crack, chip, mend, and colour the various articles, cover
        them with dust, partially clean them, and imitate the marks and
        signatures of celebrated makers, is more creditable to their
        ingenuity than to their honesty. Still, there are a good many genuine
        old relics from the temples and from the large houses of the reduced
        Daimios to be picked up, if you go the right way to work, though the
        supply is limited.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Dealers are plentiful, and travellers, especially from
        America, are increasing in numbers. When we first made acquaintance
        with the shops we thought they seemed full of beautiful things, but
        even one day’s shopping, in the company of experienced people, has
        educated our taste and taught us a great deal; though we have still
        much to learn. There are very respectable-looking lacquer cabinets,
        ranging in price from 5s. to £20. But they are only made for the
        foreign market. No such things exist in a Japanese
        home.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page41">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A really fine

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        lacquer-making; and as an illustration I was told that many beautiful
        articles of lacquer, old and new, had been sent from this country to
        the Vienna Exhibition in 1873, but the price put on them was so
        exorbitant that few were sold, and nearly all had to be sent back to
        Japan. Just as the ship with these things on board reached the Gulf
        of Jeddo, she struck on a rock and sank in shallow water. A month or
        two ago a successful attempt was made to raise her and to recover the
        cargo, when it was found that the new lacquer had been reduced to a
        state of pulp, while the old was not in the least damaged. I tell you
        the tale as it was told to me.</span></p><a name="illo_050" id=

        Japanese fashion, at a Japanese tea-house. The establishment was kept
        by a very pleasant woman, who received us at the door, and who
        herself removed our exceedingly dirty boots before allowing us to
        step on to her clean mats. This was all very well, as far as it went;
        but she might as well have supplied us with some substitute for the
        objectionable articles, for it was a bitterly cold night, and the
        highly-polished wood passages and steep staircase felt very cold to
        our shoeless feet. The apartment we were shown into was so exact a
        type of a room in any Japanese house that I may as well describe it
        once for all. The wood-work of the roof and the framework of the
        screens were all made of a handsome dark polished wood, not unlike
        walnut.</span></p>

        screens covered with white paper, and sliding in grooves, so that you
        could walk in or out at any part of the wall you chose, and it was,
        in like manner, impossible to say whence the next comer would make
        his appearance; doors and windows are by this arrangement rendered
        unnecessary, and do not exist. You open a little bit of your wall
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page42">[pg 42]</span><a name="Pg042"
        id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>if you want to look out, and a
        bigger bit if you want to step out. The floor was covered with
        several thicknesses of very fine mats, each about six feet long by
        three broad, deliciously soft to walk upon. All mats in Japan are of
        the same size, and everything connected with house-building is
        measured by this standard. Once you have prepared your foundations
        and wood-work of the dimensions of so many mats, it is the easiest
        thing in the world to go to a shop and buy a house ready-made, which
        you can then set up and furnish in the scanty Japanese fashion in a
        couple of days.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“On one side of the room was a slightly raised daïs,
        about four inches from the floor. This was the seat of honour. On it
        had been placed a stool, a little bronze ornament, and a china vase,
        with a branch of cherry-blossom and a few flag-leaves gracefully
        arranged. On the wall behind hung pictures, which are changed every
        month, according to the season of the year. There was no other
        furniture of any sort in the room. Four nice-looking Japanese girls
        brought us thick cotton quilts to sit upon, and braziers full of
        burning charcoal to warm ourselves by. In the centre of the group
        another brazier was placed, protected by a square wooden grating, and
        over the whole they laid a large silk eider-down quilt, to retain the
        heat: this is the way in which all the rooms, even bed-rooms, are
        warmed in Japan, and the result is that fires are of very frequent
        occurrence. The brazier is kicked over by some restless or careless
        person, and in a moment the whole place is in a blaze.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following
        gives a description of a Japanese meal:—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Presently the eider-down and brazier were removed, and
        our dinner was brought in. A little lacquer table, about six inches
        high, on which were arrayed a pair of chop-sticks, a basin of soup, a
        bowl for rice, a saki cup, and a basin of hot water, was placed
        before each person, whilst the four Japanese maidens sat in our
        midst, with fires to keep the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">saki</span></span> hot and to light the tiny
        pipes with which they were provided, and from which they wished us to
        take a whiff after each dish. Saki is a sort of spirit distilled from
        rice, always drunk hot out of small cups. In this state it is not
        disagreeable, but we found it exceedingly nasty when cold.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Everything was well cooked and served, though the
        ingredients of some of the dishes, as will be seen from the following
        bill of fare, were rather strange to our ideas. Still, they were all
        eatable, and most of them really palatable.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style=
        "text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soup.<br />
        Shrimps and Seaweeds.<br />
        Prawns, Egg Omelette, and Preserved Grapes.<br />
        Fried Fish, Spinach, Young Rushes, and Young Ginger.<br />
        Raw Fish, Mustard and Cress, Horseradish, and Soy.<br />
        Thick Soup of Egg, Fish, Mushrooms, and Spinach; Grilled Fish.<br />
        Fried Chicken and Bamboo Shoots.<br />

        Hot Saki, Pipes, and Tea.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The meal concluded with an enormous lacquer box of rice,
        from which all our bowls were filled; the rice being thence conveyed
        to our mouths by means of chop-sticks. We managed very well with
        these substitutes for spoons and forks, the knack of using which, to
        a certain extent, is soon acquired. The long intervals between the
        dishes were beguiled with songs, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page43">[pg 43]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>music, and dancing, performed by professional
        singing and dancing girls. The music was somewhat harsh and
        monotonous, but the songs sounded harmonious, and the dancing was
        graceful, though it was rather posturing than dancing, great use
        being made of the fan and the long trailing skirts. The girls, who
        were pretty, wore peculiar dresses to indicate their calling, and
        seemed of an entirely different stamp from the quiet, simply-dressed
        waitresses whom we found so attentive to our wants. Still, they all
        looked cheery, light-hearted, simple creatures, and appeared to enjoy
        immensely the little childish games they played amongst themselves
        between whiles.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“After dinner we had some real Japanese tea, tasting
        exactly like a little hot water poured on very fragrant new-mown hay.
        Then, after a brief visit to the kitchen, which, though small, was
        beautifully clean, we received our boots, and were bowed out by our
        pleasant hostess and her attentive handmaidens.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Recommending the
        perusal of the interesting works last quoted, let us finish our trip
        on paper at its natural termination, so far as the route from San
        Francisco is concerned, in China, to which country the American
        vessels take us in a week or so.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hong Kong is a
        commercial port of the first order, but has not come up to the
        expectations once made of it. It has not progressed in the same ratio
        as has Shanghai. Its situation is picturesque. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Fancy to yourself the rock of Gibraltar, on a large
        scale, looking to the north. There facing us is <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">terra
        firma</span></span>. Let us scramble up to the flag-staff, proudly
        standing on the highest peak of the mountain. The sun, which is
        already low, bathes sky, earth, and sea in crude, fantastic,
        exaggerated lights. Woe be to the painter who should dare reproduce
        such effects! Happy would he be if he could succeed!</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Towards the south, the sun and the fogs are fighting
        over the islands, which at this moment stand out in black groups on a
        liquid gold ground, framed in silver. Towards the north we look over
        the town, officially called Victoria, and vulgarly Hong Kong. It is
        stretched out at our feet, but we only perceive the roofs, the
        courts, and the streets; further on the roadstead is crowded with
        frigates, corvettes, gun-boats, steamers belonging to the great
        companies, and an infinity of smaller steam and sailing vessels of
        less tonnage. In front of us, at three or four miles distance, is a
        high chain of rocks, bare and rugged, but coloured by the setting sun
        with tints of rose colour and crimson, resembling a huge coral
        bracelet. That is the continent. Towards the west are the two
        passages which lead to Canton and Macao; to the north-east is a third
        passage, by which we ourselves have come. The sea here is like a
        lake, bordered on one side by the rocks of <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">terra
        firma</span></span>, and on the other by the peaks and summits of the
        Hong Kong cliffs. I have seen in many other lands softer and more
        harmonious effects of light, but I never saw any so
        strange.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Victoria is charming, sympathetic, and imposing: English
        and yet tropical—a mixture of cottages and palaces. Nowhere can be
        found a happier combination between the poetry of nature and the
        prose of commercial life; between English comfort and the
        intoxicating exuberance of the south. The streets, which are well
        macadamised, well kept, and beautifully clean, run in a serpentine
        fashion along the rock, sometimes between houses, of which the rather
        pretentious façades are coquettishly veiled by the verandahs,
        sometimes between gardens, bamboo hedges, or stone balustrades. It is
        like Ventnor or Shanklin seen through a magnifying-glass and under a
        jet of electric light. Everywhere there are fine trees—banians,
        bamboos, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page44">[pg 44]</span><a name=
        "Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and pines. One may go
        on foot from one end of Hong Kong to the other, and yet always be in
        the shade. No one dreams of walking. Nothing is to be seen but chairs
        or palanquins. The coolies, their heads sheltered by enormous straw
        hats, carry you at a rattling pace. Nothing can be more delicious
        than a night promenade in an open sedan-chair. In the lower part of
        the town the scene is most animated and busy; officers and soldiers
        in red uniforms and with swarthy complexions (Sepoys), Parsees,
        Hindoos, Chinese, Malays, European ladies in elegant toilets, and men
        and women with yellowish skins, dressed like Europeans (half-caste
        Portuguese). The higher you climb the quieter you find it. Insensibly
        the town turns into country. Scramble up still a little higher, and
        you are in the middle of rocks, bare of trees, but covered with
        odoriferous shrubs, and traversed by a fine macadamised road, with
        glimpses of views here and there of marvellous beauty.”</span><a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shanghai, as
        another leading port, would naturally be visited by the tourist of
        leisure, and it affords a wonderful example of English enterprise. It
        is by nature the port of Suchow, ninety miles up the great
        Yang-tse-Kiang river. Near the city its flat, green, cultivated
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page45">[pg 45]</span><a name="Pg045"
        id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>banks recall the Humber in
        Yorkshire. The port is crowded with foreign shipping: great American
        steamships, the boats of the English P. and O. Company, those of the
        French <span class="tei tei-q">“Messageries,”</span> merchant
        steamers straight from London, Liverpool, and Glasgow, and sailing
        vessels in numbers. In a picturesque point of view the place has
        little to recommend it, but commercially it is a lively place,
        nine-tenths of the capital employed being English, and the white
        population counting at least six Englishmen to all the rest of the
        foreigners put together. There are three <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“concessions,”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
        tracts ceded by the Chinese to the English, French, and Americans,
        for commercial purposes. Stone being scarce, these concessions are
        fringed by enormous wooden wharves, slips, and piers, outside the
        warehouses, depôts, and stores. There are streets of well-filled
        shops, where everything is to be obtained that could be bought in the
        Strand or Oxford Street. In this point of view, Hübner tells us,
        neither Yokohama nor any other European town in Asia, saving Calcutta
        and Bombay, can bear a comparison with Shanghai. The Chinese do not
        adopt numerals for their shops and warehouses, but use mottoes and
        descriptive titles, and the great English houses have adopted the
        custom of the country. Messrs. Dent &amp; Co. have for their
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nom de
        maison</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“Precious and

        Francisco, Honolulu, and Fiji, the bulk of the voyage being usually
        over the quieter parts of the Pacific; it takes the passenger, of
        course, through the tropics.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Honolulu, the
        capital of the Hawaiian or Sandwich Islands, is now a civilised and
        pleasant city, while the natural attractions of the islands
        themselves are many and varied. One need not now fear the fate of
        poor Captain Cook. Most of the natives, of whom there are 50,000, are
        clothed in semi-European style: the men in coats and trousers of
        nankeen, and the women more picturesquely clad in long robes fastened
        round the neck, and pretty often of pink or some other bright colour.
        There is a white population of some 10,000 souls scattered over the
        islands, a large proportion of whom are English and American.
        Honolulu is the Government centre and residence of King Kalakau, who
        used to be called <span class="tei tei-q">“Calico”</span> in the
        United States, and who, in fact, is a very slightly tinted,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page46">[pg 46]</span><a name="Pg046"
        id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>good-looking, and most
        intelligent gentleman. The Ex-Queen Emma, who visited England some
        years ago, has a villa beautifully situated a few miles out of town.
        The king devotes his energies to bettering the condition of his
        people, and some few years ago, when the money was voted to build a
        new palace, declined to accept it, at least for two years. The
        Hawaiian Parliament consists of a House of seventeen nobles and
        twenty-eight commoners, who, strange to say, sit in the same hall,
        their votes being of equal weight. There are always several Europeans
        or Americans in this council.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Guillemard
        thus describes Honolulu<a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href=
        "#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a>:—<span class="tei tei-q">“The
        town, which is built on the low land bordering the shore—partly,
        indeed, on land reclaimed from the sea, thanks to the industry of the
        architects of the coral reef—looks mean and insignificant from the
        harbour, but on going ashore to breakfast we get glimpses of fine
        public buildings and numerous shops and stores, of neat houses
        nestling among bowers of shrubs and flowers, and evidences of a busy
        trade and considerable population. The streets are narrow, and the
        houses built of wood, without any attempt at decoration or even
        uniformity. In the by-streets or lanes pretty verandah-girt villas
        peep out from shrubberies of tropical foliage, honeysuckle, roses,
        lilies, and a hundred flowers strange to English eyes. Tiny fountains
        are sending sparkling jets of water up in the hot, still air; and
        other music is not wanting, for here and there we hear the tinkle of
        a distant piano, telling us that early rising is the rule in
        Honolulu, and suggesting as a consequence a <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">siesta</span></span> at
        mid-day.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But here we are at the grand Hawaiian Hotel, a fine
        verandahed building, standing back from the road in a pretty garden,
        the green lawn, cool deep shade, and trickling fountain of which are
        doubly grateful after the glare of the scorching sunlight, scorching
        even though it is not yet seven a.m. The theatre, half-hidden by its
        wealth of honeysuckle and fan-palm, is not fifty yards distant, but
        is quite thrown into insignificance by the hotel. This was built by
        Government, at a cost of £25,000, and is admirably planned and
        appointed.”</span> Its large airy rooms and cool verandahs, shaded
        with masses of passion flowers, its excellent food and iced American
        drinks, all combine to make it a capital resting-place.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the streets Mr.
        Guillemard noted bevies of gaily-attired girls on horseback, their
        robes being gathered in at the waist with bright scarves, which fling
        their folds far over the horses’ tails. Their jaunty straw hats were
        wreathed with flowers, and now and then some dark-eyed beauty would
        be found wearing a necklace of blossoms. The girls rode astride up
        and down the main streets, making them ring again with their merry
        laughter. Mosquitoes were abundant, and, as some compensation, so
        also were delicious melons, guavas, mangoes, bananas, and commoner
        fruit.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sugar-cane was
        first grown on these islands in 1820; now over 20,000,000 pounds of
        sugar are produced annually by the aid of Hawaiian and Chinese labour
        and steam-mills. Not a quarter of the land suitable for this purpose

        from Honolulu some of the largest and most wonderful volcanoes in the
        world are to be found. Two of them, Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea, are each
        over 13,000 feet in elevation. The eruptions from the great crater of
        Kilauea, which is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        something fearful. One explosion ejected streams of red mud three
        miles, killing thirty-one people and 500 head of cattle. This was
        followed by several earthquakes, which destroyed a number of houses.
        These, again, were succeeded by a great earthquake wave, during the
        continuance of which three villages were swept away and seventy
        people killed. Next a new crater formed upon Mauna Loa, from which
        rose four fountains of red-hot lava to a height of 600 feet. A lava
        stream, eight to ten miles long, and half a mile wide in some places,
        carried all before it. In one place it tumbled, in a molten cataract
        of fiery liquid, over a precipice several hundred feet in height. The
        interior of Hawaii is a vast underground lake of fire, and were it
        not for the safety-valves provided by Nature in the form of craters,
        it would be shaken to pieces by successive earthquakes.</p><a name=

        the detour to New Zealand considerably increases the length of the
        voyage. It will be remembered that these islands were formally
        annexed to Britain in 1874, after vain attempts at a mixed native and
        European government. The population was then 140,000; in a year or
        two afterwards 40,000 of the poor natives fell victims to the
        measles, another of the importations apparently inseparable from
        civilisation. The Wesleyan missionaries, in particular, have worked
        with so much zeal in these islands that more than half the people are
        Christians. There are 600 chapels in the 140 islands comprising the
        Fiji group. Formerly the natives were the worst kind of cannibals.
        They not merely killed and ate the victims of their island wars, but
        no shipwrecked or helpless person was safe among them. Numbers were
        slain at the caprice of the chiefs, especially at the building of a
        house or canoe, or at the reception of a native embassy. Widows were
        strangled at the death of their husbands, and slaves killed on the
        decease of their masters. The introduction of Christianity and
        partial civilisation has changed all that for the better; and the
        natives of to-day are described as mild and gentle, and little given
        to quarrelling. Among their customs is that of powdering the hair
        (always closely cropped) with lime, which is often coloured. Their
        huts are of dried reeds, lashed to a strong framework of poles, and
        have lofty arched roofs, but are without windows or chimneys. Each
        has two low doors, through which one must crawl. The best native huts
        have a partition between the dwelling and bed room, and all are
        carpeted with mats. The only furniture consists of one article, a
        short piece of wood on two small legs, used for a pillow! Clay pots
        are used for cooking their principal diet, yams and fish. Many of
        them nowadays have houses well furnished with mats, curtains,
        baskets, jars, &amp;c.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Guillemard
        describes a tropical dinner, served to himself and companions in one
        of these huts. A couple of banana-leaves formed the dishes, on which
        boiled fish and half a dozen yams, or sweet potatoes, were offered. A
        large block of rock-salt was handed them to use <span class=

        neatly, and tied round with a fibre, formed the post-prandial cigars,
        which were lighted by the women at the fire, and passed from their
        lips to the guests’.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The natural
        productions of this group are extensive, and comprise bread-fruit,
        taro, cocoa-nuts, yams, bananas, plantains, guavas, oranges and
        lemons, wild and cultivated tobacco, sugar, cotton, and coffee. The
        india-rubber tree is cultivated, and among the leading exports are
        dried cocoa-nut and pearl-shell. As there are at the present time
        comparatively few white settlers—perhaps not over 2,500 in all the
        islands—there are innumerable openings for settlement, and Fiji, with
        many other neighbouring islands, will doubtless soon afford fresh
        examples of British enterprise.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The point touched
        by the steamers is Kandavu, on one of the southernmost islands, where
        Mount Washington, a fine mountain, rears its head 3,000 feet into the
        clouds. A visitor says:—<span class="tei tei-q">“From the eastern
        point of land run out miles of coral reef, on which the ocean rollers
        are breaking grandly, and outside this barrier we take our pilot on
        board. The entrance to Kandavu harbour is narrow and intricate, and
        here the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=

        steamers, struck on a submerged reef, and remained for several days
        hard and fast aground.”</span> The passage has been properly buoyed
        and lighted, and the New Company have built offices and stores, and
        established a coaling station here.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The view of Port Ugaloa from the entrance is very
        beautiful. On our left the coral reef encloses a still lagoon of the
        softest, lightest green; before us hills and mountains, covered from
        base to summit with the richest vegetation, are tipped with fleecy
        cloud; and on our right, dividing the waters of the bay, is Ugaloa
        Island, its slopes feathery with the foliage of the cocoa-palm and
        banana, half hidden in which appear here and there the low brown huts
        of the natives.... The brothers L. accompany me ashore on Ugaloa,
        landing close to a small collection of huts scattered about just
        above the coral-strewn beach. It is Sunday afternoon, and a native
        missionary is preaching to some fifty men, women, and children,
        squatting on their hams on the mat-covered floor of a neat,
        white-washed mission house. Amongst the congregation is a tall
        native, with a thick cane, keeping silence by tapping the heads of
        the inattentive. The preacher is eloquent and energetic in gesture;
        but Fiji is hardly a pretty language to listen to, being decidedly
        characterised by queer guttural sounds, and spoken very fast. The
        sermon over, a hymn is read out and sung to a rather monotonous
        dirge-like chant, and the congregation disperse. We are at once
        surrounded by an olive-skinned crowd; the ladies’ dresses are
        minutely examined, for a white lady has scarcely been seen in Kandavu
        before the present year. The gentlemen have to display their watches
        and chains, and by means of shouting and signs every one is soon
        carrying on a vigorous conversation. Why is it that one always
        elevates the voice when trying to make one’s native tongue
        intelligible to a foreigner?</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        that we are thirsty, and wish to refresh ourselves with the juice of
        a green cocoa-nut. Clutching the trunk with both hands, he almost
        runs up a palm, and our wants are soon plentifully supplied. He
        receives his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        are early disturbed by the chattering of a hundred natives, a whole
        squadron of whose fruit-laden canoes are alongside the steamer. Queer
        crank-looking craft are these, roughly dug out of the trunk of a
        tree, and kept steady on the water by an outrigger consisting of a
        log half the length of the canoe, attached to it amidships by a few
        light poles projecting some four or five feet from its side. They are
        usually propelled by means of a long oar worked between the poles,
        after the fashion of sculling a boat from the stern; but sometimes we
        see the ordinary short paddle being plied at bow and stern. Some of
        the larger craft hoist a large long sail, but they do not seem very
        weatherly under canvas, which they use but little compared with the
        Society Islanders.</span></p>

        natives, their olive skins blackened and begrimed with dust, are hard
        at work replenishing the coal bunkers from the hold, and thoroughly
        earning their shilling a day; on the poop as many more, laden with
        lemons, huge bunches of bananas, cocoa-nuts, shells, coral, matting,
        tappa—a soft, white fabric, called by the natives <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘marse’</span>—and a few clubs and other weapons, are
        driving a brisk trade with the passengers. Everything is to be had
        for a shilling. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Shillin’</span> is the only
        English word that all the natives understand; in fact, this useful
        coin seems to be the <span class="tei tei-q">‘almighty dollar’</span>
        of Kandavu. You take a lemon, and ask, <span class="tei tei-q">‘How
        much?’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘Shillin’</span> is the reply;

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our next stopping
        place is one of particular interest to the British colonist. New
        Zealand, albeit one of the youngest, is now among the most promising
        of England’s outposts. Auckland, in the North Island, is the port at
        which the steamers touch. The harbour is very fine, and residents
        compare it to the Bay of Naples.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every schoolboy
        knows that New Zealand includes two large and one small island,
        respectively known as North, Middle, and Stewart’s Island. One great
        feature of the coast line consists of its indentations; the colony is
        rich in fine natural harbours and ports. The area of the islands is
        nearly as great as that of Britain and Ireland combined, and about
        half of that area consists of excellent soil. The climate is that of
        England, with a difference: there are many more fine days, while
        winter is not so cold by half. The islands are volcanic; on the North
        Island, Mount Ruapahu, a perpetually snow-capped peak, rises to a
        height of 9,000 feet, while in the same range, the Tongariro
        mountain, an active volcano, rises to a height of 6,000 feet. The
        highest mountain range is on the Middle Island, where Mount Cook
        rises to a height of 14,000 feet. One can understand that in such a
        country there should be an abundance of evergreen forests of
        luxuriant growth. These are interspersed with charming fern-clad
        slopes and treeless grassy plains. Water is everywhere found; but
        none of the rivers are navigable by large vessels for more than fifty
        miles or so. One great advantage found in the country is the absence
        of noxious reptiles or insects: of the latter there is not one as
        offensive as an English wasp. The pigs, introduced by Captain Cook,
        run wild over the island, and there is plenty of large and small
        game: the red and fallow deer, the pheasant, partridge, and quail.
        Everything that grows in England will thrive there, while the vine,
        maize, taro, and sweet potato grow in many districts. A
        traveller<a id="noteref_21" name="noteref_21" href=
        "#note_21"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a> says of
        the (Thames) gold fields:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Mines here, like
        everywhere else, are now dull. At one time there <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>was a population of 22,000, but now this
        is only 13,000. Everybody one sees seems to have lost in the
        gold-diggings, and it is a mystery to me who is the lucky person that
        wins—one never seems to meet him.”</span> This somewhat random
        statement may be taken <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">cum grano salis</span></span>, as the
        gold-fields have yielded largely at times. Nevertheless, mining is
        always more or less a lottery.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Anthony
        Trollope testifies to the intense British feeling in New Zealand,
        where he felt thoroughly at home. Australia he found tinged with a

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Discovered by
        Tasman in 1642, England only commenced to take an interest in the
        islands more than a century and a quarter later, when Cook surveyed
        the coasts. The missionaries came first, in 1814, and a British
        Resident was appointed in 1833. All this time a desultory
        colonisation was going on, and the natives were selling parcels of
        their best lands for a few cast-iron hatchets or muskets, shoddy
        blankets, or rubbishy trinkets. In 1840 a Lieutenant-Governor was
        appointed from home, and his presence was indeed necessary. The
        previous year a corporation, calling itself the New Zealand Company,
        had made pretended purchases of tracts of the best parts of the
        country, amounting to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">one-third</span></span> of its whole area! The
        unscrupulous and defiant manner in which this company treated the
        natives and the Government brought about many complications, and led
        to very serious wars with natives not to be trifled with. The New
        Zealand Company was <span class="tei tei-q">“bought out”</span> by
        the Government in 1852 for £268,000. During 1843-7, and in 1861 and
        after, England had to fight the Maories—foes that she learned to
        respect. At last, weary of war, all our troops were withdrawn, and
        the colonists, who of course knew the bush and bush life better than
        nine-tenths of the soldiers, were left to defend their homes and
        property, and in the end to successfully finish the fight. The
        natives now are generally peaceful and subdued, while many are even
        turning their attention to agriculture and commerce. Nine years ago
        they numbered 37,500, but are fast dying out.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Physically and
        intellectually, the Maories are the finest semi-savage natives on the
        face of the earth. Mr. Trollope is an author and traveller whose
        words carry weight, and he has given us the following concise summary
        of their qualities and character:—<span class="tei tei-q">“They
        are,”</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“an active people, the
        men averaging 5 feet 6½ inches in height, and are almost equal in
        strength and weight to Englishmen. In their former condition they
        wore matting; now they wear European clothes. Formerly they pulled
        out their beards, and every New Zealander of mark was tattooed; now
        they wear beards, and the young men are not tattooed. Their hair is
        black and coarse, but not woolly like a negro’s, or black like a
        Hindoo’s. The nose is almost always broad and the mouth large. In
        other respects their features are not unlike those of the European
        race. The men, to my eyes, were better-looking than the women, and
        the men who were tattooed better-looking than those who had dropped
        the custom. The women still retain the old custom of tattooing the
        upper lip. The Maories had a mythology of their own, and believed in
        a future existence; but they did not recognise <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page52">[pg 52]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>one supreme God. Virtue with them, as with
        other savages, consisted chiefly in courage and a command of temper.
        Their great passion was revenge, which was carried on by one tribe
        against another to the extent sometimes of the annihilation of
        tribes. The decrease of their population since the English first came
        among them has been owing as much to civil war as to the injuries
        with which civilisation has afflicted them. They seem from early days
        to have acquired that habit of fighting behind stockades or in
        fortified pahs which we have found so fatal to ourselves in our wars
        with them. Their weapons, before they got guns from us, were not very
        deadly. They were chiefly short javelins and stones, both flung from
        slings. But there was a horror in their warfare to the awfulness of
        which they themselves seem to have been keenly alive. When a prisoner
        was taken in war he was cooked and eaten.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I do not think that human beings were slaughtered for
        food in New Zealand, although there is no doubt that the banquet when

        reference to the practice of cannibalism, and will then have done
        with the subject. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Whether or not cannibalism
        commenced immediately after the advent of the New Zealanders from
        Hawaiki, it is nevertheless certain that one of Tasman’s sailors was
        eaten in 1642; that Captain Cook had a boat’s crew eaten in 1774;
        that Marion de Fresne and many other navigators met this horrible
        end; and that the pioneers of civilisation and successive
        missionaries have all borne testimony to the universal prevalence of
        cannibalism in New Zealand up to the year 1840. It is impossible to
        state how many New Zealanders were annually devoured; that the number
        was not small may be inferred from two facts authenticated by
        European witnesses. In 1822, Hougi’s army ate three hundred persons
        after the capture of Totara, on the River Thames, and in 1836, during
        the Rotura war, sixty beings were cooked and eaten in two
        days.’</span> I will add from the same book a translation of a
        portion of a war-song:—<span class="tei tei-q">‘Oh, my little son,
        are you crying? are you screaming for your food? Here it is for you,
        the flesh of Hekemanu and Werata. Although I am surfeited with the
        soft brains of Putu Rikiriki and Raukauri, yet such is my hatred that
        I will fill myself fuller with those of Pau, of Ngaraunga, of Pipi,
        and with my most dainty morsel, the flesh of the hated
        Teao.’</span> ”</span></p>

        was invited to dinner at Government House during the visit of H.R.H.
        the Duke of Edinburgh. After dinner the Duke’s chief bagpiper came in
        and played. The chief was asked how he liked the music. He replied
        briefly: <span class="tei tei-q">“Too much noise for me; but suit
        white man well enough.”</span></p>

        approaching that great continent which has had, has, and will
        increasingly have, so much interest for the emigrant, who must be,
        more or less, a voyager and man of the sea. Australia, a country
        nearly as large as the United States, must be for many a day to come
        a very Paradise for the poor man.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The American
        steamers from San Francisco land one at Sydney, of which charming
        place Mr. Trollope says:—<span class="tei tei-q">“I despair of being
        able to convey to my readers my own idea of the beauty of Sydney
        Harbour;”</span> he considers that it excels Dublin Bay, Spezzia, and
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page53">[pg 53]</span><a name="Pg053"
        id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>New York. And the colonists,
        left to themselves—for England maintains no troops there now—have
        fortified it strongly. Mr. Trollope tells us of five separate armed
        fortresses, with Armstrong guns, rifled guns, guns of eighteen tons’
        weight, with loopholed walls and pits for riflemen, as though Sydney
        was to become another Sebastopol. <span class="tei tei-q">“It was
        shown,”</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“how the whole
        harbour and city were commanded by these guns. There were open
        batteries and casemated batteries, shell-rooms and gunpowder
        magazines, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page54">[pg

        There was a boom to be placed across the harbour, and a whole world
        of torpedoes ready to be sunk beneath the water, all of which were
        prepared and ready for use in an hour or two. It was explained to me
        that <span class="tei tei-q">‘they’</span> could not possibly get
        across the trenches, or break the boom, or escape the torpedoes, or
        live for an hour beneath the blaze of the guns. <span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of Melbourne,
        Victoria, mention has already been made. There are many cities with
        larger populations, but few have ever attained so great a size with
        such rapidity. Though it owes nothing to natural surroundings,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the internal appearance of the city
        is,”</span> Mr. Trollope assures us, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“certainly magnificent.”</span> It is built on the
        Philadelphian rectangular plan; it is the width of the streets which
        give the city a fine appearance, together with the devotion of large
        spaces within the limits for public gardens. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“One cannot walk about Melbourne without being struck by
        all that has been done for the welfare of the people generally. There
        is no squalor to be seen—though there are quarters of the town in
        which the people no doubt are squalid.... But he who would see such
        misery in Melbourne must search for it specially.”</span> There are
        no workhouses; their place is supplied in the colony of Victoria
        generally by <span class="tei tei-q">“Benevolent Asylums.”</span> In
        Melbourne about 12,000 poor are relieved yearly, some using the
        institution there as a temporary, and others as a permanent place of
        refuge. These places are chiefly, but not entirely, supported by
        Government aid. <span class="tei tei-q">“Could a pauper,”</span> says
        Trollope, <span class="tei tei-q">“be suddenly removed out of an
        English union workhouse into the Melbourne Benevolent Asylum, he
        might probably think that he had migrated to Buckingham
        Palace,”</span> so well are the inmates fed and cared for. There are
        no workhouses proper in any part of Australia, and the charity
        bestowed on these asylums is not given painfully or sparingly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The wideness of
        the streets, however, and grandeur of general dimensions, have their
        drawbacks, among which the time consumed in reaching distant parts of
        the city counts first. Melbourne has a fine and entirely free Public
        Library and a University, as, indeed, has Sydney. Melbourne is the
        centre of a system of railways, and the well-to-do people all live
        out of town; in the south and east of the city there are miles of
        villas and mansions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Trollope
        says:—<span class="tei tei-q">“There is perhaps no town in the world
        in which an ordinary working man can do better for himself and for
        his family with his work than he can at Melbourne.”</span> The rates
        of wages for mechanics are slightly greater than at home, and all the
        necessaries of life are cheaper. With meat at 4d. per pound, butter
        from 6d. upwards, bread, tea, and coffee about the same prices or
        rather under, coals the same or a trifle higher, potatoes,
        vegetables, and fruits generally considerably cheaper, all can live
        well and plentifully. Meat three times a day is common all over
        Australia, and in some parts the price is as low as 1½d. or 2d. per
        pound. Wages for good mechanics and artisans average about 10s. a
        day; gardeners receive about 50s., and labourers about 30s. per week;
        men-servants, in the house, £40 to £50 per annum; cooks, £35 to £45
        per year; girls, as housemaids, &amp;c., 8s. or 10s. per week. It is
        usual to hire the last named by this <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page55">[pg 55]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>short term. Some of these prices rule all over
        the country, but are liable to rule lower, rather than higher,
        outside of Melbourne.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the country
        sheep-shearers can earn 7s. to 14s. per day for about four months in
        the year; shepherds, £30 to £40 per year, with rations. The common
        labourer can count on 15s. to 20s. per week, with rations: these
        consist generally of 14 lbs. meat (usually mutton), 8 lbs. flour, 2
        lbs. sugar, and a quarter of a pound of tea. Of course, where fruit
        or vegetables are plentiful they would be added. The meat, bread, and
        tea diet, however, is that characteristic of the whole country. In
        the great sheep runs and cattle ranges<a id="noteref_23" name=
        "noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a> it would
        be the shepherd’s diet invariably.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Trollope
        advises the poor man to save for three or four years, and then invest
        in land, which in some places is to be had at 3s. 9d. an acre,
        payable to the Government in five instalments of ninepence per acre.
        Of course, he would require money for the erection of a house, farm
        implements, &amp;c. The great trouble with most men working in the
        bush as shepherds or shearers, or at the mines, or elsewhere at
        distant points, is that the enforced absence from civilisation and
        social life makes them inclined for reckless living when they have
        accumulated a sum of money. The tavern-keepers of the nearest town or
        station reap all the benefit, and there are numbers of men who, for
        ten or eleven months of the year perfectly steady and sober,
        periodically give themselves up to drink until their earnings are
        melted, it is called <span class="tei tei-q">“knocking down”</span>
        one’s cheque, and it is a common practice for them to hand such
        cheque to the publican, who lets them run on recklessly in drink and
        food until <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">he</span></span> considers it exhausted. A good
        story is told by Mr. Trollope of a man who had been accustomed to do
        this at regular intervals, but who on one occasion, having some loose
        silver, <span class="tei tei-q">“planted”</span> his cheque in an old
        tree, and proceeded to the usual haunt, where he set to work
        deliberately to get drunk. The publican showed evident doubt as to
        the propriety of supplying him freely. Why had not the man brought
        his cheque as usual? The tavern-keeper at last put him to bed; but
        the man, though drugged and stupefied, had his wits about him
        sufficiently to observe and remember that the host had examined his
        clothes, his hat, and boots, for the lacking cheque. Next morning he
        was ignominiously expelled from the house, but he didn’t mind: the
        cheque was found by him safely in the tree by the roadside, and he
        surprised his master by returning to the station a week or two before
        he was expected richer than he had ever come home before. Let us hope
        he was cured of that form of folly for ever.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The gold yield of
        Australia for the twenty years between 1851 and 1871 was 50,750,000
        ozs. But gold-fields die out sooner than most mines, and Australia
        has a more permanent source of prosperity for the future in its coal
        and iron-fields, which are in close proximity to each other. The coal
        is already worked to great profit, and is one of the principal
        steamship fuels of the Pacific.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The steamship
        route homeward from Australia is that by the Indian Ocean (usually

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These pages have
        already presented episodes in the lives of many seafaring ladies, but
        till now no chapter has been specially devoted to the subject. In
        these days of general travel ladies make, as we have often seen, long
        voyages to and from far distant parts. One of them, some nineteen
        years ago, underwent the horrors of shipwreck, and her subsequent
        sufferings were admirably told by her under the title of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ten Terrible Days.”</span> The account, which should be
        read in its entirety, is here, for obvious reasons, considerably
        condensed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One day late in
        the year 1861 a grain-laden vessel, a fine clipper, might have been
        seen slowly and gracefully sailing out of the noble bay of San
        Francisco. On her as passengers were two or three ladies with
        children, among them Mrs. William Murray, the authoress, who had been
        recommended to take the long voyage home in a roving clipper, in
        preference to taking a passage in the over-crowded steamers running
        to Panama and New York. Let her open the story. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The sun,”</span> says she, <span class="tei tei-q">“was
        shining as it always does in California, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page57">[pg 57]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>until the sea and the rocks and the vast city
        seemed literally glittering with sunlight. One long look back to the
        happy home of the last six years, to the home still of the husband
        and brothers obliged to remain behind, and at last I had only the sea
        that parted us to look at through my tears. Our friends had seen us
        set sail in what seemed a gallant ship. It had been chosen from all
        others as the one to send us home in for its show of perfectness.
        There were men in San Francisco who knew that the ship was
        unseaworthy (having been frightfully strained in her last voyage to
        China), and that she was in no fit condition to be trusted with the
        lives of helpless women and children, yet they let us sail without a
        word of warning.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The dreaded Horn
        had been easily rounded in good weather, and on the evening of
        January 4th, 1862, they had been eighty-six days out; in ten more
        they expected to be in England. The sailors had predicted a stormy
        night, and a terrific gale followed closely on that prophecy. The
        wind increased in fury, and the ship rolled till those on board were
        often thrown from their feet. That night a child was born on board,
        and the kindly lady passengers did all in their power for the poor
        mother.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“At dawn,”</span> says Mrs. Murray, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“taking my little girl by the hand, I went on deck. The
        storm had in some measure abated, but the sea looked black and
        sullen, and the swell of the vast heavy waves seemed to mock our
        frailty. The sailors had been up all night, and were <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page58">[pg 58]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>as men playing at some ferocious game:
        some working in desperation at the pumps, and singing at the pitch of
        their voices wild sea-songs to time their common efforts; others
        employed in throwing hundreds of bags of grain into the sea, that
        they might thus lighten the ship. This, I think, more than all,
        showed me our peril. I wandered about, too miserable to remain in any
        one spot, till the captain assembled us all once more in the cabin to
        get some food, saying that it was impossible to save the ship, and
        that we should have need of all our fortitude. I remembered my own
        vain attempt to eat some bread, but the poor little children took
        their breakfast and enjoyed it.</span></p>

        couple of warm shawls. On the top of a box I saw a little parcel that
        had been entrusted to me by a lady in California to deliver to her
        mother in Liverpool. I put that in my bag, and she got it.... There
        had been no thought of removing the breakfast, and with the rolling
        of the ship, which was every moment becoming worse, everything had
        fallen on the floor, and was dashing about in all directions. Boxes,
        water-jugs, plates, dishes, chairs, glasses, were pitching from one
        end of the saloon to the other. Children screaming, sailors shouting
        and cursing, and loud above all there was the creaking of timbers,
        and the sullen sound of water fast gaining upon us in the hold of the
        ship, which groaned and laboured like a living thing in
        agony.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How the ridiculous
        will intrude even at such times is shown in the following. A little
        boy was discovered helping himself out of the medicine-chest,
        particularly busy with the contents of a broken calomel bottle!
        Lamp-oil served as an emetic in this emergency, and the youngster’s
        life was saved. And now the first mate, upon whose decision and
        firmness much depended, having lost his presence of mind, had drunk
        deeply of whisky. He was intoxicated, and so, too, were many of the
        sailors, who had followed his example. The captain, meantime, had
        been busily employed in ordering out food and water to supply the
        boats, collecting the ship’s papers, &amp;c. The lowering of the
        boats he had entrusted to his officers. On hearing of the drunkenness
        on deck, his first thought was to get the women and children off at
        once, for should the sailors seize the boats, what would become of
        them? Two boats had already been smashed whilst lowering them into
        the sea, and there were only two remaining. Forty-seven people to
        cram into two frail boats, fifteen hundred miles from land:
        delicately-nurtured women, helpless children, drunken and desperate
        men.</p><a name="illo_068" id="illo_068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the help of the
        most sober of the sailors, the captain’s own boat was lowered; some
        small mattresses, pillows, blankets, a cask of water, sacks of
        biscuit, and nautical instruments, were first put in; then the
        passengers were let down by ropes. <span class="tei tei-q">“It seems
        marvellous,”</span> says Mrs. Murray, <span class="tei tei-q">“when I
        think of it now, that in our descent we were not dashed to pieces
        against the ship’s side. We had to wait for each descent a favourable
        moment while she was leaning over. Then the word of command was
        given, and we were slung down like sheep. My heart stood still whilst
        my little one was going down, and then I followed. It was a terrible
        sight for a woman to see that poor creature whose baby was born the
        night before, looking like a corpse in a long dressing-gown of white
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page59">[pg 59]</span><a name="Pg059"
        id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>flannel, with the poor little
        atom of mortality tightly clasped in her arms. I thought she would
        die before the day was over.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At last they were
        all in the boat: four women, five children, the second mate, and
        sixteen sailors. The captain stayed on the ship, providing for the
        safety of the drunken creatures who could not take care of
        themselves, and then he came off. How small the boat looked by the
        side of the tall ship! And they had to get quickly out of her reach,
        for she was rolling so heavily that the waters near her boiled up
        like a maelström.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Away they drifted,
        a mere speck upon the ocean. Before night there came a storm of
        thunder, lightning, wind, and rain, that lasted through the darkness,
        and by which they were drenched through and through. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I sat up,”</span> says the narrator, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“for some twelve or fourteen hours on a narrow plank,
        with my child in my arms, utterly miserable, cold, and hopeless,
        soaked to the skin, blinded by the salt spray, my face and hands
        smarting intolerably with the unusual exposure.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the storm
        and confusion the greater part of their biscuit had been soaked with
        salt water, and made useless. It was also discovered that the food
        collected for the captain’s boat had been thrown by mistake into the
        other, therefore it was necessary at once to put them on allowance:
        half a pint of water and half a biscuit a day to each person. Except
        the biscuit, there were only a few small tins of preserved
        strawberries and Indian corn, and these were given to the ladies.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“How the poor children cried with hunger as
        the days dragged on!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The boat leaked
        from the beginning, and the sailors by turns baled the water out in
        little cans. Exposed to the glare of a tropical sun for hours
        together, nearly mad with thirst, bearing her child in her weak arms,
        for she was too much exhausted to stand, Mrs. Murray says that often
        she would sit for hours without any thought at all, vacantly gazing
        on the ocean.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We had,”</span> says she, <span class="tei tei-q">“three
        days of dead calm. The sun glared down upon us pitilessly, and I
        thought how pleasant it would be to throw myself into the sea, and
        sink calmly to death beneath its waves. I lost all wish to live—for
        life seemed horrible. I cannot describe the days as they passed
        separately, one by one; when I look back upon them, they all seem to
        have been one misery. I remember that on the third day out poor
        Kitty’s baby died—indeed, it had been dying from the first. It never
        had a chance of living, for it had no fit attention and no
        sustenance. The poor mother cried bitterly when at last it became
        cold on her bosom, but its death was a merciful release. Wrapped in a
        shawl of bright colours, it was thrown overboard, but was so light
        that it could not sink, and floated for hours on a sea so calm in the
        hot sun that scarce a ripple could be seen. At last it disappeared
        suddenly, the prey of some hungry shark, and when afterwards the
        horrid monsters crowded round our boat they added to our misery.
        Hitherto the children had been plunged into the sea every morning to
        preserve them in health, but we dared not continue this practice with
        those horrid creatures on our lee.... I must not forget one incident,
        trifling in itself, but which might have caused the death of one of
        the sailors. On the day of the wreck I had caused two or three
        bottles of ale and one of claret to be put in the boat, thinking it
        might be of great use to us. On the third or fourth night out, when
        we were shivering helplessly after a drenching <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page60">[pg 60]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>shower of rain, we thought that a bottle
        of ale should be opened for the women and children, but not a bottle
        of any sort was to be found.”</span> The rage of the captain was
        awful, and but for the intercession of the ladies, he swore that he
        would have thrown the man overboard.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was on the
        morning of the tenth day that the frightful thought of eating the
        children came into the heads of three or four desperate men, and the
        captain and a few trustworthy companions had made up their minds to
        slay the would-be murderers that very night in their sleep. The last
        and fatal hour of their great agony seemed to be come. On the morning
        of the tenth day a sail was reported, and a white towel hoisted to
        attract her attention. She came near enough for the captain to make
        out that she carried the Hamburg flag, and then <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“passed by on the other side.”</span> Curses loud and
        deep came from the sailors’ lips. Then the women looked into each
        other’s faces and the children cried, and the wolfish eyes of the
        would-be cannibals were again fixed upon them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Heaven was
        merciful, and again a sail was reported. Nearer and nearer she came,
        faster rowed the hungry sailors, when there rose a wild shout,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“She has stopped!”</span> and surely there
        she was at rest in the water, waiting to see what manner of beings
        they were. <span class="tei tei-q">“Row faster, my men, and keep down
        the women and children,”</span> sang out the <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page61">[pg 61]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>captain, for he was fearful that if their number
        was discovered the vessel might pass them, as had that seen in the
        morning.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Oh, what a lovely afternoon,”</span> says Mrs. Murray,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“that was when we were saved—such a blaze of
        sunshine, such blue skies, such a glistening, glowing sea, as if even
        the treacherous ocean were rejoicing with us. At length we were close
        alongside of the ship, and saw crowds of human beings clustering
        about to look at us—dark, swarthy faces, for they were all Spaniards,
        but full of pity, wonderment, and horror. They took us all in, one by
        one, and when they saw the women and little children they wept. They
        could not speak our language, and looked upon us with bewilderment,
        but when I (who fortunately could speak Spanish), kneeling down on
        deck, said <span class="tei tei-q">‘Gracias a Dios’</span> (Thank
        God), their tongues were loosened, and there was a flood of questions
        and crowding round us, with weeping and laughing and shaking of
        hands. How good were those kind-hearted men! How I thank them all,
        every one, now as I write, from the worthy captain down to the lowest
        of his crew. And they brought us bread and wine and water—precious
        water, how good it was!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few of Mrs.
        Brassey’s experiences on her husband’s yacht will be read with
        interest. One day, after their five o’clock dinner, she and some of
        her children very nearly met with a most serious accident.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“We were all sitting,”</span> writes that
        lady, <span class="tei tei-q">“or standing about the stern of the
        vessel, admiring the magnificent dark blue billows following us, with
        their curling white crests mountains high. Each wave, as it
        approached, appeared as if it must overwhelm us, instead of which it
        rushed grandly by, rolling and shaking us from stem to stern, and
        sending fountains of spray on board.... A new hand was steering, and
        just at the moment when an unusually big wave overtook us he
        unfortunately allowed the vessel to broach to a little. In a second
        the sea came pouring over the stern, above Allnut’s head. The boy was
        nearly washed overboard, but he managed to catch hold of the rail,
        and with great presence of mind stuck his knees into the bulwarks.
        Kindred, our boatswain, seeing his danger, rushed forward to save
        him, but was knocked down by the return wave, from which he emerged
        gasping.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The coil of rope on which Captain Lecky and Mabelle were
        seated was completely floated by the sea. Providentially, however, he
        had taken a double turn round his wrist with a reefing point, and,
        throwing his other arm round Mabelle, held on like grim death;
        otherwise, nothing could have saved them. She was perfectly
        self-possessed, and only said quietly, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Hold
        on, Captain Lecky, hold on!’</span> to which he replied, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘All right.’</span> I asked her afterwards if she thought
        she was going overboard, and she answered, <span class="tei tei-q">‘I
        did not <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">think</span></span> at all, mamma, but felt sure
        we were gone.’</span> Captain Lecky, being accustomed to very large
        ships, had not in the least realised how near we were to the water in
        our little vessel, and was proportionately taken by surprise. All the
        rest of the party were drenched, with the exception of Muriel, whom
        Captain Brown held high above the water in his arms, and who lost no
        time in remarking, in the midst of the general confusion <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘I’m not at all wet, I’m not!’</span> Happily, the
        children don’t know what fear is. The maids, however, were very
        frightened, as some of the sea had got down into the nursery, and the
        skylights had to be screwed down. Our studding-sail-boom, too, broke
        with a loud crack when the ship broached to, and the jaws of the
        fore-boom gave way.</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Soon after this adventure we all went to bed, full of
        thankfulness that it had ended as well as it did; but also not, so
        far as I am concerned, to rest in peace. In about two hours I was
        awakened by a tremendous weight of water suddenly descending upon me
        and flooding the bed. I immediately sprang out, only to find myself
        in another pool on the floor. It was pitch dark, and I could not
        think what had happened; so I rushed on deck, and found that, the
        weather having moderated a little, some kind sailor, knowing my love
        of fresh air, had opened the skylight rather too soon, and one of the
        angry waves had popped on board, deluging the cabin.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Sunbeam</span></span>
        encountered a wreck, and the account given of its inspection will be
        read with interest. Mrs. Brassey says:—<span class="tei tei-q">“When
        I went on deck, at half-past six, I found a grey, steamy, calm
        morning, promising a very hot day, without wind.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“About 10.30 a.m. the cry of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Sail on the port helm!’</span> caused general
        excitement, and in a few minutes every telescope and glass in the
        ship had been brought to bear upon the object which attracted our
        attention, and which was soon pronounced to be a wreck. Orders were
        given to starboard the helm and to steer direct for the vessel; and
        many were the conjectures hazarded and the questions asked of the
        fortunate holders of glasses. <span class="tei tei-q">‘What is
        she?’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘Is there any one on
        board?’</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‘Does she look as if she had
        been long abandoned?’</span> Soon we were near enough to send a
        boat’s crew on board, whilst we watched their movements anxiously
        from the bridge. We could now read her name—the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Carolina</span></span>—surmounted by a gorgeous
        yellow decoration on her stern. She was of between two and three
        hundred tons burden, and was painted a light blue with a red streak.
        Beneath her white bowsprit the gaudy image of a woman served as a
        figure-head. The two masts had been snapped short off about three
        feet from the deck, and the bulwarks were gone, only the covering
        board and stanchions remaining, so that each wave washed over and
        through her. The roof and supports of the deck-house and the
        companions were still left standing, but the sides had disappeared,
        and the ship’s deck was burst up in such a manner as to remind one of
        a quail’s back.... We saw the men on board poking about, apparently
        very pleased with what they had found; and soon our boat returned to
        the yacht for some breakers, as the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Carolina</span></span> had been laden with port
        wine and cork, and the men wished to bring some of the former on
        board. I changed my dress, and putting on my sea-boots, started for
        the wreck.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We found the men rather excited over their discovery.
        The wine must have been very new and very strong, for the smell from
        it as it slopped about all over the deck was almost enough to
        intoxicate anybody. One pipe had already been emptied into the
        breakers and barrels, and great efforts were made to get some of the
        casks out whole; but this was found to be impossible, without
        devoting more time to the operation than we chose to spare. The men
        managed to remove three half empty casks with their heads stove in,
        which they threw overboard, but the full ones would have required
        special appliances to raise them through the hatches. It proved
        exceedingly difficult to get at the wine, which was stowed underneath
        the cork, and there was also a quantity of cabin bulkheads and
        fittings floating about under the influence of the long swell of the
        Atlantic. It was a curious sight, standing on the roof of the
        deck-house, to look into the hold, full of floating bales of cork,
        barrels, and pieces of wood, and to watch the sea surging up in every
        direction through and over the deck, which was level with the water’s
        edge. I saw an excellent modern iron <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page63">[pg 63]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>cooking-stove washing about from side to side;
        but almost every other movable article, including spars and ropes,
        had apparently been removed by previous boarders.”</span> It would
        have delayed them too long to tow her into port, or they might have
        recovered some £1,500 as salvage, while to blow her up would have
        required more powder than they had on board. So she was left
        helplessly drifting about, a danger to any vessel running into her
        full steam or sail almost as great as a sunken rock.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Later, the owner
        of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Sunbeam</span></span> was of real service, for a
        fine vessel was encountered, under full sail and on fire, her cargo
        being smelting coal. Her red Union Jack was upside down, while her
        signals read the terrible announcement, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ship
        on fire!”</span> These were followed by the signal, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Come on board at once,”</span> and a boat’s crew was at
        once despatched to the rescue. They were purposely well armed, and
        for the sufficient reason that there was little sign of fire or smoke
        on board, and it was thought that there might be a mutiny on board.
        In a few minutes the boat returned with the chief mate, a
        fine-looking Norwegian, who reported his vessel the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Monkshaven</span></span>, sixty-eight days from
        Swansea, and bound for Valparaiso. The fire had been discovered five
        days previously, and the morning following the first day the crew had
        got all their clothes and provisions on deck, and had thrown
        everything of a combustible nature—tar, oil, pitch, spare spars, and
        so forth—overboard. The hatches had then been battened down, but all
        efforts to subdue the fire were unavailing. The officers and men had
        been living on deck under a canvas screen, the water being a foot
        deep even there. When the hatches were opened for a moment, dense
        clouds of hot, suffocating yellow smoke immediately poured forth,
        driving back all who approached. In such cases it is often difficult
        to find the location of the fire, which may at any time burst open
        the deck or burn a hole through the hull. The dangerous nature of
        such cargoes may be inferred from the fact that of every three
        vessels going out to Valparaiso or Callao, one catches fire,
        although, of course, the flames are often got under control. They had
        encountered a terrific gale, and while burning had signalled a large
        American steamship, which had contemptuously steamed away from them.
        When the men had all been transferred to the yacht—for it was found
        impossible to save the barque—the poor fellows were almost wild with
        joy and excitement. Soon after the fated vessel was blazing like a
        tar-barrel, and the yacht steamed round her near enough for all on
        board to feel the heat. Fifteen extra mouths to feed was a serious
        addition to the passengers and crew of the <span class=

        to be cut down, but otherwise they had all they could wish, and a

        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Illimani</span></span>, then homeward bound. The
        satisfaction which must have been felt by Mr. and Mrs. Brassey at
        having the ability as well as the will to save fifteen lives may well
        be imagined.</p>

        noblest attributes is her readiness to help in the hour of need, and
        its exercise has been by no means confined to the land. Late in 1879
        the British India Steam Navigation Company’s steamer <span class=

        abandoned their posts and gave themselves up to despair, and the
        passengers <span class="tei tei-q">“passed”</span> coal to the

        id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>which occurred in fresh water,
        is only one of scores that might be recorded here. On the 5th
        December, 1879, two men had to cross the St. Lawrence River, from La
        Rue Island to a wharf on the main shore. It was an intensely cold
        day, and a heavy gale was blowing strongly from the north-east up the
        river. The men loaded their punt with a sleigh, and had managed to
        reach the middle of the channel, when a sudden and violent gust of
        wind swamped the punt and turned her over. The men clung to her while
        bottom upward, and tried to <span class="tei tei-q">“tread”</span>
        the water so as to get her to the shore, but in vain; the cold was so
        intense that their legs were benumbed above the knees, and they gave
        themselves up for lost. They remained in this perilous position for a
        considerable time, shouting loudly for help till their throats were
        sore. Making a final effort, they shouted again, and this time their
        cries were heard at the house of a Mr. Darling, who, with his family,
        resided close to the shore. That gentleman was ill in bed, but his
        wife and daughters, Maggie and Jessie, were at home, the men and boys
        being at work in the fields at a distance. On hearing the last
        painful shout of the drowning men, they quickly opened the door, to
        see them struggling in the great river—a stream the width and volume
        of which surpass anything in Europe. The first suggestion from the
        mother was to fetch the men from the fields, but before this could be
        done brave Maggie and Jessie—the latter a girl of sixteen years—had,
        without a word, launched the skiff, and were rowing with all their
        strength through the troubled waters and driving storm. They had the
        greatest difficulty in reaching the exhausted and helpless men, but
        at last their noble effort was rewarded, and in ten minutes the poor
        fellows were being chafed and warmed by their father’s fire. Brave
        Maggie and Jessie! worthy successors, indeed, to your namesake, the
        heroine of the Longstone Light!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The story of Grace
        Darling must be familiar to our readers. The circumstances which
        called forth her courage and humanity were as follow:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Forfarshire</span></span>, a steamer of moderate
        size, left Hull for Dundee on the evening of September 5th, 1838,
        having on board a considerable amount of freight and sixty-three
        passengers and crew. Soon after leaving the Humber the boilers began
        to leak, and on Thursday morning the weather became very tempestuous,
        while a thick mist enveloped the vessel. The steamer managed to pass
        the Fern Islands, on the way north, early on Thursday evening, but
        had all she could do to make headway in a very heavy sea, while the
        alarming fact was discovered that her boilers’ leakage was
        increasing. As the night advanced the weather became more and more
        boisterous, and somewhere off Berwick it was found that the water
        from above was deluging the furnace fires. Off St. Abb’s Head, the
        engineer reported that the machinery would work no longer; the sails
        were accordingly set, and the vessel allowed to drive before the
        wind, which took her southward. Before daybreak on Friday morning the
        roar of breakers near at hand was heard; and the captain tried hard
        to avert the appalling catastrophe which seemed inevitable, and steer
        the vessel between the islands and the mainland, through a channel
        known as the Fair Way. But the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Forfarshire</span></span>
        would not answer her helm, and was driven hither and thither by a
        furious sea. The scene at this juncture baffles description. Utter
        darkness enveloped the doomed vessel, over which the sea broke in
        tremendous waves, and the noise of which almost drowned the agonising
        shrieks of the passengers. The vessel, a few minutes later, struck a
        rock, her bows banging and crashing upon it. At this moment
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page65">[pg 65]</span><a name="Pg065"
        id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a rush was made by eight of the
        crew to a boat, which they lowered successfully, one almost naked and
        frenzied passenger jumping into it after them. The ship was now at
        her last extremity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A moment or two
        after the first shock, another great sea struck her, raising her high
        in the air and then bringing her down with a terrific crash on the
        jagged reef, and with a shock so tremendous that she literally broke
        in two. The whole of the upper part of the vessel, including the
        chief cabin, filled with passengers, was swept away, and sank almost
        immediately. Every soul on that part of the vessel was engulfed in an
        ocean grave. Good George Herbert says truly, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He that will learn to pray, let him go to
        sea.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fore part of
        the vessel remained spitted on a rocky projection; and had the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Forfarshire</span></span> drifted a few yards
        further to the south-west she would have escaped her terrible fate,
        as the rock there descends almost precipitously into deep water.
        Meantime, at the Fern Lighthouse, a mile off, nothing had been seen
        of the actual occurrence, but at seven o’clock the vessel was noticed
        lying on the rock. The weather was so bad that the lighthouse-keeper,
        Mr. Darling, doubted the possibility of rendering assistance. But his
        daughter Grace entreated her father to go off in the boat at all
        risks, and offered herself to take one oar. Mr. Darling, thus urged,
        though knowing the danger of the attempt, agreed, and mother and
        daughter aided him in launching the boat. After a hard pull through
        the boiling foam, they reached the rock, where they found nine
        persons shivering in the cold and wet, and trembling for their lives.
        As illustrative of the heroism displayed in this rescue, it may be
        mentioned that had it not been ebb tide the boat could not have
        passed between the islands; and Darling and his daughter knew that
        the tide would be flowing on their return, and that their united
        strength would have been quite insufficient to pull back to the
        lighthouse. But for the assistance of the survivors all would have
        had to remain on the fatal rock. The joy of the rescued people may
        well be imagined, and their surprise, and indeed amazement, at
        finding that one of their deliverers was a young girl. At the
        lighthouse food and warmth soon restored their exhausted powers.
        Among those rescued was a bereaved mother, who had seen her two only
        children perish before her eyes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Grace Darling’s
        name and fame are historic; she lived but a short time after the

        Queries</span></span>,<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href=

        as follows, and his opinion is entitled to respect. He
        says:—<span class="tei tei-q">“I have arrived at the conclusion that
        the phrase is derived from the Scriptural account of the prophet
        Jonah. The word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">locker</span></span>, on board ship, generally
        means the place where any particular thing is retained or kept, as
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘the bread locker,’</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘shot locker,’</span> &amp;c. In the ode in the second
        chapter of the Book of Jonah, we find that the prophet, praying for
        deliverance, describes his situation in the following
        words:—<span class="tei tei-q">‘In the midst of the seas; and the
        floods compassed me about; the depth closed me round about; the earth
        with her bars was about me.’</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The sea, then, might not misappropriately be termed by a
        rude mariner Jonah’s locker: that is, the place where Jonah was kept
        or confined. Jonah’s locker, in time, might readily be corrupted to
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However this may
        be, it is of the hidden treasures of the ocean locker and its

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pearl oyster
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Meleagrina
        margaritifera</span></span>) is the most valuable and interesting of
        all the nacre (mother-of-pearl) bearing shells. The shell is nearly
        round, and greenish in colour on the outside; it furnishes at once
        the finest pearls, under favourable circumstances, and the nacre so
        useful in many industrial arts. Fine pearl and nacre have, in short,
        the same origin. The nacre invests the whole interior of the shell,
        being the same secretion which, in the pearl, has assumed the
        globular form; in one state it is deposited as nacre on the walls of
        the bivalve, in the other as a pearl in the fleshy interior of the
        animal. Between nacre and pearls, therefore, there is only the
        difference of the form of the deposition. The finest
        pearls—<span class="tei tei-q">“solidified drops of dew,”</span> as
        the Orientals poetically term them—are secretions of nacrous material
        spread over foreign bodies which have accidentally got beneath the
        mantle of the mollusc. The animal, if irritated by the intrusion of
        only a grain of sand, and being unable to remove it, covers it with a
        natural secretion, and the pearl gradually grows in size. Almost
        invariably some foreign body is found in their centre, if broken,
        which has served as a nucleus to this concretion, the body being,
        perhaps, a sterile egg of the mollusc, the egg of a fish, or a grain
        of sand, round which has been deposited in concentric layers the
        beautiful and much prized gem.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Chinese and
        other Eastern nations turn this fact in the natural history of this
        bivalve to practical use in making pearls and cameos. By introducing
        into the mantle of the mollusc, or into the interior of its body, a
        round grain of sand, glass, or metal, they induce a deposit which in
        time yields a pearl, in the one case free, and in the other adhering
        to the shell.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pearls are
        sometimes produced in whole chaplets by the insertion of grains of
        quartz connected by a string into the mantle of a species of
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Meleagrina</span></span>; in other cases, a
        dozen enamelled figures of Buddha seated have been produced by
        inserting small plates of embossed metal in the valves of the same
        species. The pearls are very naturally small at first, but increase
        by the annual layers deposited on the original nucleus, their
        brilliancy and shade of colour varying with that of the nacre from
        which they are produced. Sometimes they are diaphanous, silky,
        lustrous, and more or less iridescent; occasionally they turn out
        dull, obscure, and even smoky.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pearl oyster
        is met with in very different latitudes. They are found in the
        Persian Gulf, on the Arabian coast, and in Japan, in the American
        seas, and in the islands of the South Sea; but the most important
        fisheries are found in the Bay of Bengal, Ceylon, and other parts of
        the Indian Ocean. The Ceylon fisheries are under Government
        inspection, and each year, before the fisheries commence, an official
        inspection of the coast takes place. Sometimes the fishing is
        undertaken on account of the State, at other times it is let to
        parties of speculators. In 1804 the pearl fishery was granted to a
        capitalist for £120,000; but, to avoid impoverishing all the beds at
        once, the same part of the gulf is not fished every year; and,
        indeed, sometimes the oysters disappoint the scientists and practical
        finders by migrating.</p><a name="illo_079" id="illo_079" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great fishery
        for mother-o’-pearl takes place in the Gulf of Manaar, a large bay to
        the north-east of Ceylon. It occupies 250 boats, which come from
        different parts of the coast; they reach the ground at daybreak, the
        time being indicated by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page68">[pg
        68]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a
        signal gun. Each boat’s crew consists of twenty hands and a negro.
        The rowers are ten in number. The divers divide themselves into two
        groups of five men each, who labour and rest alternately; they
        descend from forty to fifty feet, seventy being about the utmost they
        can accomplish, and eighty seconds the longest period the best diver
        can remain under water, the ordinary period being only thirty
        seconds. In order to accelerate their descent a large stone is
        attached to a rope. The oars are used to form a stage, across which
        planks are laid over both sides of the boat; to this stage the
        diving-stone is suspended. This stone is in the form of a pyramid,
        weighing thirty or more pounds; the cord which sustains it sometimes
        carries in its lower part a sort of stirrup to receive the foot of
        the diver. At the moment of his descent he places his right foot in
        this stirrup, or, where there is no such provision, he rests it on
        the stone with the cord between his toes. In his left foot he holds
        the net which is to receive the bivalves; then seizing with his right
        hand a signal cord conveniently arranged for this purpose, and
        pressing his nostrils with the left hand, he dives, holding himself
        vertically, and balancing himself over his foot. Each diver is naked,
        except for a band of calico which surrounds his loins. Having reached
        the bottom, he withdraws his foot from the stone, which ascends
        immediately to the stage. The diver throws himself on his face, and
        begins to gather all the proper shells within his reach, placing them
        in his net. When he wishes to ascend he pulls the signal cord, and is
        drawn up with all possible expedition. A good diver seldom remains
        more than thirty seconds under water at one time, although some can
        remain considerably longer, but he repeats the operation three or
        four, and, in favourable circumstances, even fifteen or twenty times.
        The labour is extremely severe, and they are short-lived. On
        returning to the boat they sometimes discharge water tinged with
        blood by the mouth, nose, and ears. They are also exposed to great
        danger from sword-fish and sharks, which lie in wait for and
        frequently devour the unhappy <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page69">[pg 69]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>victim. They continue to fish till mid-day, but
        are expected to return long before dark. Mrs. Brassey explains that
        when a boat with pearls reaches the shore the shells are divided into
        equal heaps, one-fourth going to the boat’s crew and three-fourths to
        the Government inspector. They keep whichever heap he chooses to
        kick, so that, being uncertain in which heap the best pearls are, the
        chances are good enough. The heaps <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page70">[pg 70]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>are then divided and sold by auction in
        thousands, and then sub-divided again. Gambling is such an Oriental
        proclivity that the merest beggar will buy a few of the shells,
        hoping to find a pearl of great value; and should he fail to do so,
        he still has got his oyster! <span class="tei tei-q">“Some of the
        oysters are taken in sealed-up sacks to Colombo, Kandy, and other
        inland places, in order to enable people to indulge their love of
        gambling and speculation.”</span> Sir Emerson Tennant tells us that
        the depleted pearl oyster-shells of the Condatchy fisheries, which
        date back two thousand years, form an immense bank on the beach,
        extending for miles. In past times the Ceylon fisheries were more
        valuable than at present. In 1797 they are said to have produced
        £144,000, and in 1798 as much as £192,000. In 1802 the fisheries were
        farmed for £120,000; but for many years the banks have been less
        productive, and are now said to yield only the sum of £20,000 per
        annum.</p><a name="illo_080" id="illo_080" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The natives of the
        Bay of Bengal, those of the Chinese coast, of Japan, and the Indian
        Archipelago, all devote themselves to the pearl fishery, the produce
        being estimated to realise at least £800,000. Fisheries analogous to
        those of Ceylon take place on the Persian coast, on the Arabian Gulf,
        along the coast of Muscat, and in the Red Sea. Arrived on their
        fishing-ground, the fishermen of the Red Sea range their barques at a
        proper distance from each other, and cast anchor in water from eight
        to nine fathoms deep. The process is pursued here in a very simple
        manner. When about to descend, the divers pass a cord, the extremity
        of which communicates with a bell placed in the barque, under the
        armpits; they put cotton in their ears, and press the nostrils
        together with a piece of wood or horn; they close their mouths
        hermetically, attach a heavy stone to their feet, and at once sink to
        the bottom of the sea, where they gather indiscriminately all shells
        within their reach, which they throw into a bag suspended round their
        haunches. When they require to breathe they sound the bell, and
        immediately they are assisted in their ascent. On the oyster-banks
        off the isle of Bahrein the pearl fishery produces about £240,000;
        and if we add to this the product of the other fisheries in the
        neighbourhood, the sum total yielded by the Arabian coast would
        probably not fall short of £350,000. In South America similar
        fisheries exist. Before the Mexican conquest the pearl fisheries were
        located between Acapulco and the Gulf of Tchuantepic; subsequently
        they were established round the islands of Cubagua, Margarita, and
        Panama. The results became so full of promise that populous cities
        were not slow to raise themselves round these several places. Under
        the reign of Charles V. America sent to Spain pearls valued at
        £160,000; in the present day the annual yield is estimated to be
        worth £60,000.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pearls form, of
        course, the most important product of the animal. When they are
        adherent to the valves they are detached with pincers; but as a rule
        they are found in the oyster’s soft tissues. In this case the
        substance is boiled, and afterwards sifted, in order to obtain the
        most minute of the pearls; for those of considerable size are
        sometimes overlooked in the first operation. Months after the mollusc
        is putrefied miserable Indians may be observed busying themselves
        with the corrupt mass, in search of small pearls which may have been
        overlooked by the workmen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pearls
        adherent to the valve are more or less irregular in their shape; they
        are sold by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page71">[pg
        71]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>weight. Those found in the body of the animal,
        and isolated, are called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">virgin pearls</span></span>. They are globular,
        ovoid, or pyriform, and are sold by the individual pearl. In cleaning
        them, they are gathered together in a heap in a bag, and worked with
        powdered nacre, in order to render them perfectly pure in colour and
        round in shape, and give them a polish; finally, they are passed
        through a series of copper sieves, in order to size them. These
        sieves, to the number of a thousand, are made so as to be inserted
        one within the other, each being pierced with holes, which determine
        the size of the pearl and the commercial number which is to
        distinguish it. Thus, the sieve No. 20 is pierced with twenty holes,
        No. 50 with fifty holes, and so on up to No. 1,000, which is pierced
        with that number of holes. The pearls which are retained in Nos. 20
        to 80, said to be <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">mill</span></span>, are pearls of the first
        order; those which pass and are retained between Nos. 100 and 800 are
        vivadoe, or pearls of the second order; and those which pass through
        all the others, and are retained in No. 1,000, belong to the class
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tool</span></span>, or seed pearls, and are of
        the third order. They are afterwards threaded; the small and
        medium-sized pearls on white or blue silk, arranged in rows, and tied
        with ribbon into a top-knot of blue or red silk, in which condition
        they are exposed for sale in rows, assorted according to their
        colours and quality. The small or seed pearls are sold by measure or
        weight.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We cannot wonder
        at the estimation in which these beautiful productions of nature have
        always been held. Our Lord speaks of <span class="tei tei-q">“a
        merchantman seeking goodly pearls,”</span> and once of a <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“pearl of great price.”</span> The ancients held them in
        great esteem. Ahasuerus had a chamber with tapestry covered with
        valuable pearls. Julius Cæsar offered to Servilia, the mother of
        Brutus, an <span class="tei tei-q">“Orient pearl,”</span> valued at
        money representing a million sesterces;<a id="noteref_27" name=

        Cleopatra’s expensive draught is estimated by Pliny at the equivalent
        of £80,729; Lollia Paulina, wife of Caligula, used to put on about
        £200,000 sterling’s worth of them on high days and holidays.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In our own country
        Sir Thomas Gresham powdered up a pearl worth £65,000, in Queen
        Elizabeth’s time, and drank it up <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">à la</span></span>
        Cleopatra, excepting only that he took it in wine instead of in
        vinegar. It was done in vain-glory to outshine the Spanish
        ambassador, with whom he had wagered to give a more expensive
        entertainment than he could.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Scottish pearls,
        which are slightly bluish in tint, were much celebrated in the Middle
        Ages, and were sent to London from the rivers Tay and Isla; the trade
        carried on in the present century, the Rev. Mr. Bertram tells us, has
        become of considerable importance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pearl,
        according to the same authority, is found in a variety of the mussel
        which is characterised by the valves being united by a broad hinge.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The pearl fisheries of Scotland,”</span> he
        adds, <span class="tei tei-q">“may become a source of wealth to the
        people living on the large rivers, if prudently conducted.”</span>
        Mr. Unger, a dealer in gems in Edinburgh, having discerned the
        capabilities of the Scotch pearl as a gem of value, has established a
        scale of prices which he gives for them, according to their size and
        quality; and the beautiful pearls of our Scottish streams are now
        admired beyond the Orient pearl. Empresses and queens, and royal and
        noble ladies, have made large purchases of these gems. Mr. Unger
        estimates the sum paid to pearl-finders in the summer of 1864 at
        £10,000. The localities successfully fished have been the classic
        Doon, the Forth, the Tay, the Don, the Spey, the Isla, and most of
        the Highland rivers of note.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The coral was long
        considered a sea-plant, but what was once taken for a flower is, in
        fact, a kind of polyp, which lives in colonies. A branch of living
        coral is an aggregation of animals united among themselves by a
        common tissue, yet seemingly enjoying a separate existence. The
        branch undoubtedly owes its origin to an egg, and consists of two
        distinct parts—the one hard, brittle, and stony; the other external,
        and soft and fleshy. The latter is a united family of polyps, animals
        having feelers or tentacles, and very sensitive, and further,
        possessing generative or budding powers. The subject is, however, of
        a nature too scientific to be fully treated here. The Greeks called
        it a <span class="tei tei-q">“daughter of the sea,”</span> and as in
        so many other things, they were right. The fisheries are principally
        confined to the Mediterranean, and the fishing is conducted mainly by
        sailors from Genoa, Leghorn, and Naples. It is so fatiguing that it
        is a common saying in Italy that a sailor obliged to go to the coral
        fishery must either be a thief or an assassin. The saying conveys a
        good idea enough of the occupation. The best men can only earn four
        to six hundred francs (£16 to £24) in the season of six months. They
        work eighteen hours per diem, and are allowed very little more
        rations than unlimited biscuit and water. <span class=

        fifteen tons; they are strong, and well adapted for the labour; their

        "tei tei-q">“When the padrone thinks he has reached a coral bank, he
        throws his engine overboard. As soon as the apparatus is fairly at
        the bottom the speed of the vessel is slacked, <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the capstan is manned by six or eight men,
        while the others guide the helm and trim the sails. Two forces are
        thus brought to act upon the lines, the horizontal action of the
        vessel and the vertical action of the capstan. In consequence of the
        many inequalities of the rocky bottom, the engine advances by jerks,
        the vessel yielding more or less according to the concussion caused
        by the action of the capstan or sail. The engine seizes upon the
        rugged rocks at the bottom, and raises them to let them fall again.
        In this manner the swab, floating about, penetrates beneath the rocks
        where the coral is found, and is hooked on to it. To fix the lines
        upon the coral and bring them home is a work of very great labour.
        The engine long resists the most energetic and repeated efforts of
        the crew, who, exposed half naked to the burning sun of the
        Mediterranean, work the capstan to which the cable and engine are
        attached, while the padrone urges and excites them to increased
        exertion; the sailors meanwhile trim the sails, and sing with a slow
        and monotonous tone a song, the words of which improvise in a sort of
        psalmody the names of the saints most revered among the seafaring
        Italian population.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The lines are finally brought home, tearing or breaking
        blocks of rock, sometimes of enormous size, which are brought on
        board. The cross is now placed on the side of the vessel, the lines
        are arranged on the deck, and the crew occupy themselves in gathering
        the results of their labour. The coral is gathered together, the
        branches of the precious alcyonarian are cleansed and divested of the
        shells and other parasitic products which accompany them; finally,
        the produce is carried to and sold in the ports of Messina, Naples,
        Genoa, or Leghorn, where the workers in jewellery purchase them.
        Behold, fair reader, with what hard labour, fatigue, and peril, the
        elegant bijouterie with which you are decked is torn from the deepest
        bed of the ocean.”</span> Coral is worth from as little as two or

        Darwin<a id="noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href=
        "#note_28"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a> has
        reasoned very conclusively on the formation of the reefs. He
        says:—<span class="tei tei-q">“The earlier voyagers fancied that the
        coral-building animals instinctively built up their great corals to
        afford themselves protection in the inner parts; but so far is this
        from the truth, that those massive kinds to whose growth on the
        exposed outer shores the very existence of the reef depends cannot
        live within the lagoon, where other delicately-branching kinds
        flourish.”</span> Moreover, in this view, many species of distinct
        genera and families are supposed to combine for one end; and of such
        a combination not a single instance can be found in the whole of
        Nature. The theory that has been most generally received is that
        atolls are based on submarine craters, but when the form and size of
        some of them are considered this idea loses its plausible character.
        Thus, the Suadiva atoll is forty-four geographical miles in diameter
        in one line by thirty-four in another; Rimsky is fifty-four by twenty
        miles across; Bow atoll is thirty miles long, and, on an average, six
        miles broad. This theory, moreover, is totally inapplicable to the
        Northern Maldivian atolls in the Indian Ocean, one of which is
        eighty-eight miles in length, and between ten and twenty in <a name=
        "corr074" id="corr074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class=
        "tei tei-corr">breadth.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The various
        theories which had been propounded as to the existence of the coral
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page75">[pg 75]</span><a name="Pg075"
        id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>islands being unsatisfactory,
        Mr. Darwin was led to re-consider the whole subject. Numerous
        soundings taken all round the Cocos atoll showed that at ten fathoms
        the prepared tallow in the hollow of the sounding rod came up
        perfectly clean, and marked with the impression of living polyps. As
        the depth increased these impressions became less numerous, but
        adhering particles of sand succeeded, until it was evident that the
        bottom consisted of smooth mud. From these observations it was
        obvious to him that the utmost depth at which the coral polyps can
        construct reefs is between twenty and thirty fathoms. Now, there are
        enormous areas in the Indian Ocean in which every island is a coral
        formation, raised to the height to which the waves can throw up
        fragments and the winds pile up sand; and the only theory which seems
        to account for all the circumstances embraced is that of the
        subsidence of vast regions in this ocean. <span class="tei tei-q">“As
        mountain after mountain and island after island slowly sank beneath
        the water,”</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“fresh bases
        could be successively afforded for the growth of the corals. I
        venture to defy any one to explain in any other manner how it is
        possible that numerous islands should be distributed throughout vast
        areas, all the islands being low, all built of coral, absolutely
        requiring a foundation within a limited depth below the
        surface.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Darwin’s
        description of the island of Cocos, or Keeling, is as
        follows:—<span class="tei tei-q">“The ring-formed reef of the lagoon
        island is surmounted in the greater part of its length by linear
        islets. On the northern or leeward side there is an opening through
        which vessels can pass to the anchorage within. On entering, the
        scene was very curious and rather pretty; its beauty, however,
        entirely depended on the brilliancy of the surrounding colours. The
        shallow, clear, and still water of the lagoon, resting in its greater
        part on white sand, is, when illuminated by a vertical sun, of the
        most vivid green. This brilliant expanse, several miles in width, is
        on all sides divided, either by a line of snow-white breakers from
        the dark heaving waters of the ocean, or from the blue vault of
        heaven by the strips of land crowned by the level tops of the
        cocoa-nut tree. As a white cloud here and there affords a pleasing
        contrast to the azure sky, so in the lagoon bands of living coral
        darken the emerald-green water.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The next morning I went ashore on Direction Island. The
        strip of dry land is only a few hundred yards in width; on the lagoon
        side there was a white calcareous beach, the radiation from which,
        under this sultry climate, was very oppressive. On the outer coast, a
        solid, broad, flat coral rock served to break the violence of the
        open sea. Excepting near the lagoon, where there is some sand, the
        land is entirely composed of rounded fragments of coral. In such a
        loose, dry, stony soil, the climate of the intertropical regions
        alone could produce so vigorous a vegetation.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“On some of the smaller islets nothing could be more
        elegant than the manner in which the young and full-grown cocoa-nut
        trees, without destroying each other’s symmetry, were mingled into
        one wood. A beach of glittering white sand formed a border to those
        fairy spots.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mrs. Brassey
        writes enthusiastically of some coral fields in the South Pacific.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“It is really impossible to describe the
        beauty of the scene before us. Submarine coral forests of every
        colour, studded with sea-flowers, anemones, and echinidæ, of a
        brilliancy only to be seen in dreamland; shoals of the brightest and
        swiftest fish darting and flashing in and out; <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page76">[pg 76]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>shells, every one of which was fit to hold
        the place of honour in a conchologist’s collection moving slowly
        along with their living inmates: this is what we saw when we looked
        down from the side of the boat into the depths below. The surface of
        the water glittered with every imaginable tint, from the palest
        aquamarine to the brightest emerald, from the pure light blue of the
        turquoise to the deepest dark blue of the sapphire, and was dotted
        here and there with patches of red, brown, and green coral, rising
        from the mass below. Before us, on the shore, there spread the rich
        growth of tropical vegetation, shaded by palms and cocoa-nuts, and
        enlivened by the presence of native women in red, blue, and green
        garments, and men in motley costumes, bringing fish, fowls, and
        bunches of cocoa-nuts, borne, like the grapes brought back from the
        land of Canaan by the spies, on poles.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“At 5 p.m. we went for a row in the <span class=

        and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Flash</span></span> to the coral reef, now
        illumined by the rays of the setting sun. Who can describe these
        wonderful gardens of the deep, on which we now gazed through ten and
        twenty fathoms of crystal water! Who can enumerate or describe the
        strange creatures moving about and darting hither and thither amid
        the masses of coral forming their submarine home! There were shells
        of rare shape, brighter than if they had been polished by the hand of
        the most skilful artist; crabs of all sizes scuttling and sliding
        along; sea-anemones spreading their delicate feelers in search of
        prey, and many other kinds of zoophytes crawling slowly over the
        reef, and scarlet, blue, yellow, gold, violet, spotted, striped, and
        winged fish, short, long, pointed, and blunt, of the most varied
        shapes, were darting about like birds among the coral
        trees.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Darwin speaks of
        the grandeur of the outer shore of these lagoon islands. He
        says:—<span class="tei tei-q">“There is a simplicity in the
        barrier-like beach, the margin of green bushes and tall cocoa-nuts,
        the solid flat of dead coral rock, strewed here and there with great
        loose fragments, and the line of furious breakers all rounding away
        towards either hand. The ocean, throwing its waters over the broad
        reef, appears an invincible, all-powerful enemy; yet we see it
        resisted, and even conquered, by means which at first seem most weak
        and insufficient. It is not that the ocean spares the rock of coral;
        the great fragments scattered over the reef and heaped on the beach
        whence the tall cocoa-nut-trees spring plainly bespeak the
        unrelenting power of the waves. Nor are any periods of repose
        granted; the long swell caused by the gentle but steady action of the
        trade-winds, always blowing in one direction over a wide area, causes
        breakers almost equalling in force those during a gale of wind in the
        temperate regions, and which never cease to rage. It is impossible to
        behold these waves without feeling a conviction that an island,
        though built of the hardest rock—let it be porphyry, granite, or
        quartz—would ultimately yield and be demolished by such an
        irresistible power. Yet these low, insignificant coral islets stand,
        and are victorious; for here another power, as an antagonist, takes
        part in the contest. The organic forces separate the atoms of
        carbonate of lime one by one from the foaming breakers, and unite
        them into a symmetrical structure. Let the hurricane tear up its
        thousand huge fragments, yet what will that tell against the
        accumulated labour of myriads of architects at work night and day,
        month after month? Thus do we see the soft and gelatinous body of a
        polyp, through the agency of the vital laws, conquering the great
        mechanical power of the waves of an ocean which neither the art of
        man nor the inanimate works of nature could successfully
        resist.”</span> The poet summed the matter rightly when he
        wrote:—</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page77">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now we arrive
        at the last of the valuable fisheries in which divers are
        concerned—that of the sponge. The ancients recognised the fact that
        the sponge exhibited vitality, but were rather undecided as to
        whether it should be counted animal or vegetable. Rondelet—the friend
        of the celebrated Rabelais, whom the merry curate of Meudon
        designated under the name of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Rondibilis</span></span>—himself a physician and
        naturalist of Montpellier, long promulgated the idea that these
        productions belonged to the vegetable kingdom. Linnæus late in life
        withdrew the sponges from among the vegetables, for he had satisfied
        himself, in short, that they fairly belonged to the animal kingdom.
        Sponges live at the bottom of the sea in from 500 to 1,250 fathoms of
        water, among the clefts and crevices of the rocks, always adhering
        and attaching themselves, not only to inorganic bodies, but even
        growing on algæ and animals, spreading, erect, or pendent, according
        to the body which supports them and their natural habit.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Figuier tells us
        that all naturalists are now satisfied of the animal nature of
        sponges, although they once were thought to represent the lowest and
        most obscure grade of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page78">[pg
        78]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>animal existence, and that so close to the
        confines of the vegetable world that it was considered difficult to
        some species to determine whether they were on the one side or the
        other. <span class="tei tei-q">“Several of them, however,”</span>
        says Mr. Gosse, <span class="tei tei-q">“if viewed with a lens under
        water while in a living state, display vigorous currents constantly
        pouring forth from certain orifices, and we necessarily infer that
        the water thus ejected must be constantly taken in through some other
        channel. On tearing the mass open, we see that the whole substance is
        perforated in all directions by irregular canals leading into each
        other, of which some are slender, and communicate with the surface by
        minute but numerous pores, and others are wide, and open by ample
        orifices; through the former the water is admitted, through the
        latter it is ejected.”</span></p><a name="illo_088" id="illo_088"

            SPONGE FISHING OFF THE COAST OF GREECE.
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the present
        time sponge fishing takes place principally in the Grecian
        Archipelago and the Syrian coasts. The Greeks and Syrians sell the
        product of their fishing to the western nations, and the trade has
        been immensely extended in recent times. Fishing usually commences
        towards the beginning of June on the coast of Syria, and finishes at
        the end of October. But the months of July and August are peculiarly
        favourable to the sponge harvest, if we may use the term. Latakia
        furnishes about ten boats to the fishery, Batoum twenty, Tripoli
        twenty-five to thirty, Kalki fifty, Simi about 170 to 180, and
        Kalminos more than 200. The boat’s crew consists of four or five men,
        who scatter themselves along the coast for two or three miles, in
        search of sponges under the cliffs and ledges of rock. Sponges of
        inferior quality are gathered in shallow waters. The finer kinds are
        found only at a depth of from twenty to thirty fathoms. The first are
        fished for with three-toothed harpoons, by the aid of which they are
        torn from their native rock, but not without deteriorating them more
        or less. The finer kinds of sponges, on the other hand, are collected
        by divers; aided by a knife, they are carefully detached. Thus the
        price of a sponge brought up by diving is much more considerable than
        that of a harpooned sponge. Among divers, those of Kalminos and of
        Psara are particularly renowned. They will descend to the depth of
        twenty-five fathoms, remain down a shorter time than the Syrian
        divers, and yet bring up a more abundant harvest. The fishing of the
        Archipelago furnishes few fine sponges to commerce, but a great
        quantity of very common ones. The Syrian fisheries furnish many of
        the finer kinds, which find a ready market in France; they are of
        medium size. On the other hand, those which are furnished from the
        Barbary coast are of great dimensions, of a very fine tissue, and
        much sought for in England. Sponge fishing is carried on at various
        other stations in the Mediterranean, but without any intelligent
        direction, and in consequence it is effected without any conservative
        foresight. At the same time, however, the trade in this product goes
        on yearly increasing; but it is only a question of time when the
        trade shall cease, the demand which every year clears the submarine
        fields of these sponges causing such destruction that their
        reproduction will soon cease to be adequate.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The finer
        varieties of toilet sponge produce a high price, often as much as
        forty shillings the pound weight for very choice specimens, a price
        which few commercial products obtain, and which prohibits their use,
        in short, to all but the wealthy. It is, therefore, very desirable
        that attempts should be made to carry out the submarine enterprise of
        M. Lamiral. With the assistance of the Acclimatisation Society of

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the Bahama
        banks and in the Gulf of Mexico the sponges grow in water of small
        depth. The fishermen—Spanish, American, and English—sink a long mast
        or perch into the water moored near the boat, down which they drop
        upon the sponges; by this means they are easily gathered.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fine, soft
        Syrian sponge is distinguished by its lightness, its fine flaxen
        colour, its form, which is that of a cup, its surface convex,
        voluted, pierced by innumerable small orifices, the concave part of
        which presents canals of much greater diameter, which are prolonged
        to the exterior surface in such a manner that the summit is nearly
        always pierced throughout in many places. This sponge is sometimes
        blanched by the aid of caustic alkalies; but this preparation not
        only helps to destroy its texture, but also changes its colour. This
        sponge is specially employed for the toilet, and its price is high.
        Specimens which are round-shaped, large, and soft, sometimes produce
        very large prices. There are many other varieties known to the
        commercial world.</p>

        invited to divers and diving aided by scientific appliances. But for

        valuable that had once disappeared beneath the waves? How properly
        build gigantic breakwaters, piers, and bridges, or examine and clear
        choked ports and channels?<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every reader
        understands the general principle involved in the construction of the
        diving-bell. Invert a tumbler in a deep vessel of water, and the
        liquid will only ascend to a certain height inside, however far down
        you place the glass. Insert a tube in a hole drilled in your tumbler,
        and blow downwards, and the water recedes still lower. This is what
        happens when the air is pumped down into the modern diving-bell. In
        descending in a diving-bell and remaining under water you will feel a
        slight inconvenience in breathing, and perhaps a tingling in the
        ears; this comes, not from scarcity of air, but from the fact that
        the atmosphere of the interior of the bell is really <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">denser</span></span>
        than it is outside; the air, forced downwards by the powerful
        air-pump, is pressed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">upwards</span></span> by the water. Readers may
        remember that Robert Fulton and his friends <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page80">[pg 80]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>remained under water in his submarine boat for
        over two hours, the air in that case being supplied from a large
        globe containing highly condensed air, which was allowed to escape as
        required. The foul air passed off from tubes in bubbles to the
        surface.</p><a name="illo_093" id="illo_093" class=

            A DIVER AT WORK (WITH SUBMARINE LAMP).
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As early as the
        year 1663 an Englishman named William Phipps, the son of a
        blacksmith, invented a plan for recovering from the bottom of the sea
        the treasures out of a Spanish vessel which had sunk on the coast of
        Hispaniola. Charles II. lent him a ship and all that was necessary
        for his enterprise, but the matter did not turn out successfully, and
        William Phipps fell into a state of the greatest poverty.
        Notwithstanding this nothing could discourage his ardour, and to set
        himself afloat again he opened a subscription list in England, of
        which the Duke of Albemarle was one of the subscribers. In 1667
        Phipps embarked in a ship of 200 tons burden, having undertaken
        beforehand to divide the profits between the twenty shareholders who
        represented the associated capital. At first starting his search
        proved altogether unavailing, and he was just beginning to despair,
        when he fell in with the golden vein. The fortunate diver returned to
        England with £200,000; £20,000 he kept for himself, and no less than
        £90,000 came to the share of the Duke of Albemarle. Phipps was
        knighted by the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page81">[pg
        81]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>king,
        and became the founder of the noble house of Mulgrave, which has
        played no inconsiderable part in the affairs of the United
        Kingdom.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is little more
        than a century and a half ago since the celebrated astronomer,
        Halley—about the first to commence those experiments in submarine
        exploration which have been continued to the present epoch—descended
        to a depth of fifty feet in a diving-bell which he had constructed.
        It was built of wood, and covered with sheet lead. The air that was
        vitiated by respiration escaped from the chamber through an air-cock,
        while the pure element was supplied by barrels, which descended and
        ascended alternately on both sides of the bell, like buckets in a
        well. These barrels, lined with metal, each contained some thirty-six
        gallons of condensed air; they were connected with the interior of
        the bell by leathern tubes. As soon as one of these air receptacles
        was exhausted another was let down. Halley himself relates that in
        1721, by the aid of this apparatus, he was able to descend with four
        other persons to a depth of nine or ten fathoms, and to remain under
        water an hour and a half.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is to Smeaton,
        the celebrated engineer of the famed Eddystone Lighthouse, that the
        diving-bell owes its leading characteristics, as he was the first to
        abolish Halley’s rather clumsy contrivance and apply the power of the
        air-pump; he also constructed the first cast-iron bell. In 1779 he
        made use of the diving-bell to repair the piles of Hexham Bridge, in
        the north of England, the foundations of the structure having been
        undermined by the violence of the current. A few years after a sad
        accident occurred from the use of Halley’s barrel apparatus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1783, Mr.
        Spalding, of Edinburgh, who had made some improvements upon the
        mechanical arrangements of Halley’s bell, but had retained the barrel
        air service, engaged to recover some of the cargo of an East-Indiaman
        which had been sunk on the Kish Bank, Ireland. He and his assistant
        went down, and after the first supply of air was exhausted the
        barrels were sent down as usual. No signal having been given for some
        time, the bell was drawn up, and Mr. Spalding and his assistant were
        found to be dead. It is supposed that by some means they failed to
        discharge the air from the barrels into the bell, and were
        consequently suffocated. The barrel service was always more or less
        dangerous, from its liability to get out of gear, and if Spalding had
        adopted the invention of Smeaton, he would not have lost his life in
        the manner he did.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The improved
        diving-bell was soon generally adopted by engineers, and played an
        important part in the works which have so altered the port of
        Ramsgate. The great engineer Rennie made constant use of the
        diving-bell in fixing the foundations of the eastern jetty, and in
        protecting it in parts against the attacks of the sea by a shield of
        solid masonry. It was extensively used in the construction of the
        Plymouth Breakwater. M. Esquiros, who visited the divers during the
        progress of that great work, gave an interesting account of their
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">modus
        operandi</span></span>:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But we now,”</span> says he, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“approached the breakwater—that causeway of giants—by the
        side of which we soon discovered an old dismasted ship. This vessel
        is rough in appearance, and covered over with a kind of pent-house
        roof. In it live, as in a floating house, the operatives who are
        still working at the breakwater. They pass, alternately, one month on
        board ship and one month on shore. One of their little sources of
        profit consists <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page82">[pg
        82]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in
        the sale of small fancy articles, which they say that they cut out
        with the blades of their pocket-knives from the rocks which they
        bring up from the bottom of the sea. Very soon I heard the loud
        throbbing of machinery, snorting and puffing like so many marine
        monsters; it was the wheezy noise of the air-pumps which supply the
        bells when buried under water....</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I then noticed a small boat managed by a sailor rowing
        it, which glided under the mouth of the bell, and from this hollow I
        saw emerge a pair of large loose boots, reaching above the knees,
        which, being followed by another pair of large boots, convinced me
        that two men were jumping down into the skiff. The boat itself, in
        fact, at once got clear of the dome, under which it had been half
        hidden, and I saw it come back to the vessel with two workmen on
        board, wet up to the waist and covered with mud. They had just
        finished making their half-day under the water, and appeared to be
        fatigued. Their swarthy complexions were tinged on the cheeks and
        forehead with a bright sanguine hue. The position of the bell was not
        at all altered; it was as if they wished to give it an opportunity to
        dry itself and breathe a little fresh air. It was then dinner hour
        for the men employed at the works. I had just been a spectator of the
        process of raising the bell to the surface; I now had to see it let
        down again to the bottom of the sea.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The same little boat which brought the two workmen to
        the great floating house took them back again, after an hour’s rest,
        to the vicinity of the diving-bell, which, hung just over the water,
        looked very much like an immense iron box open at the bottom. The
        procedure in making ready for the descent has really something rather
        imposing about it, and to an excited imagination might very well
        suggest the preparations for the execution of a sentence of death.
        Nothing is wanting for the purpose; the scaffold, the secret cell,
        and the gulf of the menacing waves are all there. The divers, thank
        goodness! do not in the least anticipate such a fate, but, on the
        contrary, seem proud to walk safely over the bottom of the sea, where
        so many others have found their grave. Be this as it may, the boat
        soon places itself underneath the bell, raised as it is three or four
        feet above the surface. The two workmen climb one after the other up
        into the inside, helped by an iron ring hung to the arched roof,
        which can easily be laid hold of by the hands. They take their places
        on two wooden benches fixed at a certain height in the hollow of the
        bell. Sometimes four, or even six, workmen have to find seats in this
        curious vehicle. When all this is done the boat goes away, and in
        another moment the voice of the foreman gives the order, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Lower away.’</span>...</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“In places where the water is troubled by sand, the diver
        often passes through a kind of twilight or submarine fog, which
        compels him to light his lamp. More often, on the contrary, the light
        is sufficiently strong to enable him to read a newspaper in small
        type. A story is told even of a lady who wrote a letter in the
        diving-bell, and dated it thus: <span class="tei tei-q">‘16th June,
        18—, at the bottom of the sea.’</span> Her courage obtained for her
        among the divers the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sobriquet</span></span> of the Diving
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Belle</span></span>.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I also wished to make my mind easy as to the lot of the
        poor workmen whom I had seen descending in the bell. The foreman
        assured me that they enjoyed every comfort in it. Have they not seats
        to rest themselves on, a wooden ledge on which to place their feet,
        an assortment of tools and necessary utensils suspended on a cord
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page83">[pg 83]</span><a name="Pg083"
        id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>or hooked on to the walls of
        their hut, which is nearly as well furnished as that of Robinson
        Crusoe’s? From all this explanation I was bound to conclude, unless
        the foreman was mixing up a little irony in what he told me, that the
        divers were quite <span class="tei tei-q">‘at home’</span> in the
        bell. The fact is, that really they pass in it a great part of their
        existence. Almost all of them suffer a great deal at first from a
        violent pain, which they themselves define as <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘a toothache gone into the ears,’</span> and they have a
        humming in the head, <span class="tei tei-q">‘as if some one had let
        fly a swarm of bees there;’</span> but these troublesome symptoms
        disappear after the second or third descent. Their confidence in this
        dry chamber, almost isolated in the midst of the turmoil of the
        ocean, approaches sometimes to temerity. In 1820, Dr. Collodon, of
        Geneva, who had gone down in a diving-bell on the coast of Ireland,
        bethought himself that at the depth at which he then was, a stone, or
        any other trifling cause obstructing the action of the air-valve,
        would be sufficient to enable the water to invade the bell. He
        confided this not very reassuring reflection to one of the divers who
        was with him. The latter, smiling, answered him by merely pointing
        out with his finger one of the glazed loopholes which were over their
        heads. The doctor examined it attentively, and ascertained, in fact,
        that the glass was cracked sufficiently to allow bubbles of air to
        escape pretty freely. This was a very different and more serious
        cause of uneasiness than the rather improbable contingency of an
        obstruction of the air-valve. The diver was well aware of the cracked
        glass, and cared nothing about it.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some time since,
        when the present writer descended in the diving-bell exhibited in
        London, a seal which then disported in the tank would rub its nose
        outside against the little glass windows, and look in, as though
        wondering what on earth a visitor was doing there in <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></span>
        element! The same poor animal afterwards came to grief in a very sad
        way. When the water was drained off out of the tank the seal got into
        the pipes below, and thence to the sewers. It was found, still alive,
        some time after, in the sewers of the Euston Road, a considerable
        distance away, but succumbed later to the mephitic influences of the
        filthy stream.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">M. Esquiros
        continues:—<span class="tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘They
        are just beginning to work’</span> was soon remarked to me by the
        superintendent, who followed, even under the waves, every movement of
        his labourers. The nature of their operations varies, of course, very
        much according to the undertaking in which they are engaged. The two
        divers who had just gone down had for their task to clear away round
        the adjacent portion of the foundation of the breakwater. As soon as
        they reach the bottom they jump off their seat, and, armed with a
        pickaxe, begin to dig into the moist sand in order to get out the
        stones. It often happens that the movement of the tide or some other
        cause disturbs the water round the rocky base of the breakwater. The
        workmen have then much trouble in seeing clearly, and complain that
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘the water is muddy.’</span> Generally,
        however, the water is so transparent, that even a cloud passing
        across the sky is visible at the bottom of the sea. The workmen also
        can labour with nearly as much ease and quite as much energy as if
        they were on land. The movements they themselves make in conjunction
        with the circumstances which surround them occasionally cause

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>calling for an <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘air bath.’</span> The air-pump redoubles its pace in
        working, and sends down to them through the pump an extra current of
        air, which soon blows away the mist.</span></p><a name="illo_097" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I was very soon enabled to judge for myself as to their
        industry; sacks which they had filled with muddy sand, and buckets
        laden with stones, came up to the surface every moment, drawn by
        cords. One might have fancied it to be the mouth of a mine, to which
        invisible arms were constantly sending up fragments of rock; but here
        the mine was the sea. The nature of their digging did not allow them
        to work very long together in the same place. The divers had already
        requested by signal to have their position shifted on the bed of the
        sound. How would they manage to comply with their wish? As regards
        air and locomotion, the men shut up in the bell depend entirely on
        the apparatus working on the surface. The chief organ of movement is
        a sort of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">traveller</span></span> on four wheels, running
        over two tramways, allowing it to come and go in every direction.
        Immediately on the signal being given from below, the bell was raised
        from the bottom of the sea, like a heavy balloon. This operation was,
        of course, carried out by means of chains, and the diving-bell
        remained for a minute or two motionless in mid-water, like the
        pendulum of a stopped clock. But the traveller begins to move, and as
        it also acts as a crane, the pulley on the surface and the bell under
        water shift their position at the same time. The divers call this
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘travelling.’</span> They can thus move from
        north to south, from east to west, backwards and forwards. As they
        are in motion, if they come upon a piece of rock which encumbers the
        bed of the sound, they give the signal to stop, and the bell becomes
        stationary, and then descends again slowly towards the block of
        stones. If <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page85">[pg
        85]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>they
        have been carried on a little too far, and want to retrace their
        steps, they communicate afresh with the men working on the surface,
        and the obliging machinery soon brings them to the exact point
        desired.”</span></p><a name="illo_098" id="illo_098" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The diving-bell
        has many times rendered service to engineers, by enabling them to
        descend and ascertain the nature of damages going on, which might
        otherwise have ruined their work. When Brunel was building the famous
        Thames Tunnel, and the current had broken through its arched roof, he
        went down in a diving-bell to see for himself the extent of the
        disaster. After a descent of nearly thirty feet, he reached a serious
        opening in the masonry, but the hole was too narrow to allow the bell
        to enter. It was therefore necessary for some one to dive into it,
        and brave Brunel immediately declared his intention <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page86">[pg 86]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of doing it. Taking hold of the end of a
        rope, he plunged into the hole, where it is said he remained nearly
        two minutes, mentally noting the damage done. So intent was he on
        this examination that he let go the rope just as his companions
        above, alarmed at his long stay below, were hauling it up. He had
        just time to catch hold of it again, and was happily drawn safely
        into the bell.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The diving dress
        was a later development, and owed much of its present practical shape
        to French men of science. The object of the dress, which is of canvas
        or india-rubber and metal, is, of course, to give each individual
        wearing it the utmost liberty of motion, while having at the same
        time a proper supply of vital air. The condensed air-reservoir is
        made of steel, and capable of resisting great pressures. The diver
        carries this apparatus on his back; from it a respiratory tube
        issues, and is terminated by an india-rubber mouth-piece, which is
        held between the lips and teeth of the diver.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The diver’s is a
        rough life, most assuredly. During the diving business on the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Royal
        George</span></span>, Private John Williams, early in the season,
        tore his hands very severely in attempting to sling a mass of the
        wreck with jagged surfaces and broken bolts. After a few days’ rest
        he reappeared in his submarine habit, and dived as before, but from
        excessive pain in the ears was again <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">hors de
        combat</span></span> till the 11th of July, when, on re-descending,
        he was grievously injured by the bursting of his air-pipe a few
        inches above the water. This casualty was indicated by a loud hissing
        noise on deck. A few seconds elapsed before the rupture could be
        traced and the opening temporarily stopped. With great alertness he
        was drawn up, and on being relieved of his helmet, presented a
        frightful appearance. His face and neck were much swelled and very
        livid, blood was flowing profusely from his mouth and ears, and his
        eyes were closed and protruding. Though partially suffocated, he
        possessed sufficient sensibility to speak of the mishap. A sudden
        shock, it seems, struck him motionless, and then followed a
        tremendous pressure, as if he were being crushed to death. A month in
        the Haslar Hospital restored him to health, and on returning to the
        wreck he at once recommenced his laborious occupation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following is a
        remarkable example of a salvage effected by the help of divers.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The packet boats <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Ganges</span></span>
        and <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">l’Impératrice</span></span> came into collision
        in the outer port of Marseilles. The <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Impératrice</span></span> had one of her wheels
        broken and the officers’ quarters damaged. One of the cabins
        contained a chest full of gold, which fell into the thick mud which
        forms the bottom of the port of Marseilles. It was important that
        this precious package should be recovered the next day. The sea was
        rough, and the exact spot where the accident occurred unknown. The
        box was not strong; its colour was black. At the supposed spot a
        plumb of sixty kilogrammes was sunk. This plumb carried two cords
        divided into metres; two divers dragged them in separate directions,
        and taking each the knot corresponding to one metre, they described
        consecutive circles, examining the ground at each step. After
        searching three hours, the gold was found, and restored to its owner,
        who had watched the operations with intense anxiety. This salvage was
        effected on February 19th, 1867, by M. Barbotin, contractor for
        submarine work at Marseilles.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The diving-bell
        proper has been much improved by another Frenchman, M. Payerne. His
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Submarine Hydrostat”</span> will descend or
        fall at the will of those inside. Thirty men may work in it with ease
        for a number of hours without inconvenience. It is, therefore, of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page87">[pg 87]</span><a name="Pg087"
        id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>great service in clearing
        ports, and in facilitating the execution of other submarine work.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The principle of the machine is very
        ingenious. Externally, it has the appearance of one large rectangular
        box, surmounted by another smaller one, completely closed in except
        at the bottom. The interior consists of three principal compartments.
        The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">hold</span></span> communicates by a large shaft
        with the upper compartment. Between these is a third compartment, or
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">orlop
        deck</span></span>, which only communicates with the others by means
        of stop-cocks. The hydrostat is twenty feet in height, and its base,
        which has the bottom of the sea for a floor, covers an area of 625
        square feet. It may be made to rise and fall at will, and it will
        readily float about like a raft.”</span> This ingenious machine has
        proved of much service. The port of Fécamp was choked up with
        shingle, which closed it against all vessels beyond a certain
        tonnage. The hydrostat was employed, and the port cleaned, and again
        opened to commerce.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The old divers are
        fond of recounting the glories of their craft, and are specially
        impressed with any information as to the fate of the vessels of the
        Armada. This spirit has been fostered no less by the successes of the
        ancestor of the Mulgraves than by the good fortune of John Gann, of
        Whitstable. The old diver was, many years since, employed on the
        Galway coast, and used to pass his evenings in a public-house
        frequented by fishermen. One of these men, repeating a tradition
        which had long existed in the district, told Gann that one of the
        Spanish vessels had been wrecked not far from that coast, and
        intimated that he himself could point out the spot. Gann, having
        finished his special job, made terms with the fisherman, and they
        were both out for many weeks dragging the spot indicated for any
        traces of the wreck. They were at last rewarded by coming upon
        obstructions with their grapnels. Gann brought out his diving
        apparatus, and sure enough the truth of the tradition was vindicated
        by the finding of a number of dollars, which had originally been
        packed in barrels. The barrels, however, had rotted away, and left
        the gold stacked in barrel shape. With the money so recovered John
        Gann built at Whitstable, his native place, a row of houses, which,
        to commemorate the circumstance, he called Dollar Row.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Corporal Harris,
        almost entirely by his own diligence, removed in little more than two
        months the wreck of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Perdita</span></span>, mooring lighter, which
        was sunk in 1783, in the course of Mr. Tracy’s unsuccessful efforts
        to weigh the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Royal George</span></span>. It was about sixty
        feet in length, and embedded in mud fifty fathoms south of that
        vessel. The exposed timbers stood only two feet six inches above the
        level of the bottom, so that the exertions of Harris in removing the
        wreck were Herculean. Completely overpowered by fatigue, he claimed a
        respite for a day or two to recruit his energies, and then resumed
        work with his accustomed assiduity and cheerfulness.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a sort
        of abnegation, an absence of jealousy, in the character of Harris
        which, as the rivalry among the divers made them somewhat selfish,
        gave prominence to his kindness. He met a comrade named Cameron at
        the bottom, who led him to the spot where he was working. For a
        considerable time Cameron had fruitlessly laboured in slinging an
        awkward timber of some magnitude, when Harris readily stood in his
        place, and in a few minutes, using Cameron’s breast-line to make the
        necessary signals, sent the mass on deck. It was thus recorded to
        Cameron’s credit; but the circumstance, on becoming known, was
        regarded with so much satisfaction that honourable mention was made
        of it in the official records.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page88">[pg 88]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lance-Corporal
        Jones, engaged on the wreck of the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Royal
        George</span></span>, one day lodged on deck from his slings a crate
        containing eighty 12-pounder shot. With singular success he laid the
        remainder of the kelson open for recovery, and then, sinking deeper,
        drew from the mud, in two hauls, nearly thirty-five feet of the keel.
        He also weighed a small vessel of six tons burden, belonging to a Mr.
        Cussell, which drove, under a strong current, upon one of the
        lighters. Becoming entangled, the craft soon filled and foundered,
        grappling, in her descent, with the ladder of one of the divers,
        grounding at a short distance from the interval between the lighters.
        Jones was selected to try his skill in rescuing her. At once
        descending, he fixed the chains under her stern, and while attempting
        to hold them in position, by passing them round the mast, the tide
        turned, the vessel swung round, and the mast fell over the side,
        burying Jones under her sails and rigging. Perilous as was his
        situation, his fearlessness and presence of mind never for a moment
        forsook him. Working from under the canvas, and carefully extricating
        himself from the crowd of ropes that ensnared him, he at last found
        himself free. A thunderstorm now set in, and, obedient to a call from
        above, he repaired to the deck; but as soon as the squall had
        subsided he again disappeared, and cleverly jamming the slings, the
        boat was hove up; but she had become a complete wreck, and was taken
        on shore.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A dangerous but
        curious incident occurred on the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Royal
        George</span></span> diving operations between Corporal Jones and
        Private Girvan, two rival divers, who, in a moment of irritation,
        engaged in a conflict at the bottom of the sea, having both got hold
        of the same floor timber of the wreck, which neither would yield to
        the other. Jones, at length, fearful of a collision with Girvan, who
        was a powerful man, got his bull-rope fast, and attempted to escape
        by it, but before he could do so Girvan seized him by the legs and
        tried to draw him down. A scuffle ensued, and Jones succeeded in
        extricating himself from the grasp of his antagonist. He then took a
        firmer hold of the bull-rope and gave a kick at Girvan, which broke
        one of the lens of Girvan’s helmet, and as water <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page89">[pg 89]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>instantly rushed into his dress, he was
        likely to have been drowned, had he not at once been hauled on board.
        Two or three days, however, at Haslar Hospital restored him; and the
        two submarine combatants resumed work together with the greatest
        cordiality.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A diver’s
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Nursery Tale”</span> must not be omitted.
        The hero, <span class="tei tei-q">“Jack”</span> (this is the name of
        a diver who <span class="tei tei-q">“lived once upon a time”</span>),
        had been busy for some weeks in gathering up the relics of a
        shipwreck, when on a certain day he saw appear at one of the windows
        of his bell the pale face of a woman, with long hair intertwined with
        sea-weed. He had often heard tell of the beauty of mermaids, who are,
        as every one knows, lovelier than the most lovely of women; but Jack
        never believed that any creature so perfect as this could have
        existed. With a voice softer than the murmuring of the waves under a
        gentle breeze, she said to him, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am one of
        the spirits of the sea. On account of your kind disposition I have
        marked you out among the rest of your companions, and I will protect
        you, but on one condition only, and that is, that you shall be sure
        to recognise me under any shape into which I may be pleased to change
        myself.”</span> The beautiful spirit disappeared, and Jack remained
        very much surprised, but with a strong feeling of joy thrilling
        within him. He prospered exceedingly in all that he undertook. But at
        last prosperity spoiled him. He kicked and ill-treated a polyp, a
        kind of devil-fish, but still an animal, and one that had done him no
        harm, not knowing that the beautiful spirit was disguised under that
        mass of ugliness. A few days afterwards an accident occurred and Jack
        was drowned. Moral: Take the advice of kindly mermaids—when you meet
        them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now for our
        last yarn, a true one. Some years ago a large vessel, having on board
        a valuable cargo, including gold bars, was run down and sunk by a
        steamship in the Thames between Northfleet and Gravesend. She was
        afterwards successfully raised <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        due, not merely to the presence of chloride of sodium, or what we
        call common salt, but to a large number of other minerals, including
        the chlorides of magnesium and potassium, the sulphates of magnesia
        and lime, carbonate of lime, <a name="corr090" id="corr090" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">sulphuretted</span>
        hydrogen, bromide of magnesia, hydrochlorate of ammonia, iodine,
        iron, copper, and even silver, varying in proportion according to
        locality. The copper plates of a ship examined at Valparaiso showed
        unmistakable traces of silver deposits. Calculations have been made
        showing that the ocean contains 2,000,000 tons of silver. In 1,000
        grains of sea-water there are thirty-eight grains of these
        ingredients and some little organic matter. The saltness of the sea
        is generally greater towards the poles, but to this statement there
        are exceptions. In parts of the Irish Channel the water contains
        salts equal to the fortieth of its weight, the saline matter rising
        to one-sixteenth of its weight off the coast of Spain. In many places
        the ocean is less salt at the surface than at the bottom. Its
        saltness increases its density and its buoyancy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Maury, a
        recognised authority, finds in the saline properties of the sea one
        of the principal forces from which the currents in the ocean proceed.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The brine of the ocean,”</span> says he,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“is the ley of the earth; from it the sea
        derives dynamical powers, and the currents their main
        strength.”</span> Let us suppose a long tank or, say, swimming-bath,
        divided in the middle by a water-tight wall, on one side of which
        should be fresh and on the other salt water, at equal levels. It is
        obvious that were the division removed the waters would not stand
        side by side as before, for the denser water would have a tendency
        not merely to mingle with the lighter, but to form a current
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        different densities.</p><a name="illo_101" id="illo_101" class=

        "tei tei-q">“is a scene of unceasing agitation; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘its vast surface rises and falls,’</span> to use the
        image suggested by Schleiden, <span class="tei tei-q">‘as if it were
        gifted with a gentle power of respiration; its movements, gentle or
        powerful, slow or rapid, are all determined by differences of
        temperature.’</span> ”</span> Heat increases its volume, and
        therefore <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page91">[pg 91]</span><a name=
        "Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>lightens it; cold
        increases its density, and it will naturally descend. These are,
        then, among the obvious reasons of its currents. The duration and
        force of winds and the tides are both disturbing influences. Such an
        oceanic marvel as the great <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Gulf Stream</span></span> could only be
        explained after a careful study of all the operating causes of its
        existence. Dr. Maury has well described it. He says:—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“There is a river in the bosom of the ocean: in the
        severest droughts it never fails, and in the mightiest floods it
        never overflows; its banks and its bottom are of cold water, while
        its current is of warm; it takes its rise in the Gulf of Mexico, and
        empties itself into the Arctic seas; this mighty river is the Gulf
        Stream. In no other part of the world is there such a majestic flow
        of water; its current is more rapid than the Amazon, more impetuous
        than the Mississippi, and its volume is more than a thousand times
        greater.”</span> This great current of water particularly influences
        the climates of Northern Europe, and especially those of Britain and
        Ireland.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Gulf Stream,
        as it issues from the Florida Channel, has a breadth of thirty-four
        miles, a depth of 2,200 feet, and moves at the rate of four and a
        half miles an <a name="corr091" id="corr091" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">hour.</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Midway in the Atlantic, in the triangular
        space between the Azores, Canaries, and Cape de Verd Islands, is the
        great Sargassum Sea, covering an area equal to the Mississippi
        Valley; it is so thickly matted over with the Gulf weed (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sargassum
        bacciferum</span></span>) that the speed of vessels passing through
        it is actually retarded, and to the companions of Columbus it seemed
        to mark the limits of navigation: they became alarmed. To the eye, at
        a little distance, it seemed sufficiently substantial to walk
        upon.”</span> The difference of temperature between the Gulf Stream
        and the waters it traverses constantly gives birth to tempests and
        cyclones. In 1780 a terrible storm ravaged the Antilles, in which
        20,000 persons perished. The ocean quitted its bed, and inundated
        whole cities; the trunks of great trees and large parts of buildings
        were tossed wildly in the air. Numerous catastrophes of this kind
        have earned the Gulf Stream the title of the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“King of the Tempests.”</span> So well had Maury studied
        the Gulf Stream and its storms, that he was enabled to point out the
        exact position of a vessel overtaken by a terrible gale. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“In the month of December, 1859,”</span> says Figuier,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the American packet <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">San
        Francisco</span></span> was employed as a transport to convey a
        regiment to California. It was overtaken by one of these sudden
        storms, which placed the ship and its freight in a most dangerous
        position—a single wave, which swept the deck, tore out the masts,
        stopped the engines, and washed overboard 129 persons, officers, and
        soldiers. From that moment the unfortunate steamer floated upon the
        waters, a waif abandoned to the fury of the wind. The day after the
        disaster the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">San Francisco</span></span> was seen in this
        desperate situation by a ship, which reached New York, although
        unable to assist her. Another ship met her some days after, but, like
        the other, could render no assistance. When the report reached New
        York two steamers were despatched to her assistance; but in what
        direction were they to go? what part of the ocean were they to
        explore? The authorities at the Washington Observatory were appealed
        to. Having consulted his charts as to the direction and limits of the
        Gulf Stream at that period of the year, Dr. Maury traced on a chart
        the spot to which the disabled steamer was likely to be driven by the
        current, and the course to be taken by the vessels sent to her
        assistance.”</span> The steamers went straight to the exact spot, and
        found the wreck; and although by that time the crew and passengers
        had been taken off by three passing vessels, it was certainly a
        triumph of science.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page92">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tides are
        produced by two pairs of great waves which travel round the earth
        each day—a greater pair caused by the attraction of the moon, a
        lesser pair caused by the sun. The moon, by reason of its nearness to
        the earth, produces by far the greater influence, but the tides are
        also subject to all kinds of local influences. The eastern coast of
        Asia and western side of Europe are exposed to extremely high tides;
        while in the South Sea Islands they scarcely reach the height of
        twenty inches. There is hardly any tide in the Mediterranean,
        separated as it is from the ocean by a narrow strait. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The highest tide which is known occurs in the Bay of
        Fundy, which opens up to the south of the isthmus uniting Nova Scotia
        and New Brunswick. There the tide reaches forty, fifty, and even
        sixty feet, while it only attains the height of seven or eight in the
        bay to the north of the same isthmus. It is related that a ship was
        cast ashore upon a rock during the night so high, that at daybreak
        the crew found themselves and their ship suspended in mid-air, far
        above the water.”</span> The winds have an immense influence on the
        height of tides, and also on the waves. The highest known waves are
        found off the Cape of Good Hope (<a href="#Pg089" class=
        "tei tei-ref">p. 89</a>) at the period of high tide, under the
        influence of a strong north-west wind which has traversed the
        Atlantic, pressing its waters round the Cape. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The billows there,”</span> says Maury, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“lift themselves up in long ridges, with deep hollows
        between them. They run high and fast, tossing their white caps aloft
        in the air, looking like the green hills of a rolling prairie capped
        with snow, and chasing each other in sport. Still, their march is
        stately and their roll majestic. Many an Australian-bound trader,
        after doubling the Cape, finds herself followed for weeks at a time
        by these magnificent rolling swells, furiously driven and lashed by
        the <span class="tei tei-q">‘brave west winds.’</span> These billows
        are said to attain the height of thirty, and even forty feet; but no
        very exact measurement of the height of waves is recorded.”</span>
        Those off Cape Horn are rather less in height. <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spray</span></span> is
        dashed over the Eddystone Light, 130 feet high. After a great storm
        in Barbadoes in 1780, some old and heavy cannons were found on the
        shore, which had been thrown up from the bottom of the sea. If waves
        in their reflux meet with obstacles, whirlpools result, such as those
        in the Straits of Messina, between the rocks of Charybdis and Scylla
        made famous by Homer, Ovid, and Virgil, and once much dreaded, but
        now little feared.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The best known
        whirlpool, the Maelström, off Lofoden, in Norway, is the result of
        opposing currents. One of the most circumstantial accounts of it is
        that of a Norwegian, Jonas Ramus, who calls it the Moskoe-strom
        (channel or stream):—<span class="tei tei-q">“Between Lofoden and
        Moskoe,”</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“the depth of the
        water is between thirty-six and forty fathoms; but, on the other
        side, towards Ver (Vurrgh), this depth decreases so as not to afford
        a convenient passage for a vessel without the risk of splitting on
        the rocks, which happens even in the calmest weather. When it is
        flood the stream runs up the country between Lofoden and Moskoe with
        a boisterous rapidity; but the roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea
        is scarcely equalled by the loudest and most dreadful cataracts, the
        noise being heard several leagues off; and the vortices or pits are
        of such an extent and depth that if a ship comes within its
        attraction it is inevitably absorbed and carried down to the bottom,
        and there beaten to pieces against the rocks; and when the water
        relaxes the fragments thereof are thrown up again. But these
        intervals of tranquillity are only at the turn of the ebb and flood
        and in calm weather, and last but a quarter <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page93">[pg 93]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>of an hour, its violence gradually returning.
        When the stream is most boisterous, and its fury heightened by a
        storm, it is dangerous to come within a Norwegian mile of it. Boats,
        yachts, and ships have been carried away by not guarding against it
        before they were within its reach. It likewise happens frequently
        that whales come too near the stream, and are overpowered by its
        violence, and then it is impossible to describe their howlings and
        bellowings, in their fruitless struggles to disengage themselves. A
        bear once attempting to swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by
        the stream and borne down, while he roared terribly, so as to be
        heard on shore. Large stocks of firs and pine-trees, after being
        absorbed by the current, rise again, broken and torn to such a degree
        as if bristles grew upon them. This plainly shows the bottom to
        consist of craggy rocks, among which they are whirled to and fro.
        This stream is regulated by the flux and reflux of the sea, it being
        constantly high and low water every six hours. In the year 1645,
        early in the morning of Sexagesima Sunday, it raged with such noise
        and impetuosity that the very stones of the houses on the coast fell
        to the ground.”</span> Kuchu and others promulgated the idea that the
        maelström is a watery abyss penetrating the globe, and issuing in
        some very remote <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page94">[pg
        94]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>part.
        This is the view held by most of the Norwegian peasantry and
        fishermen to-day.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Who that has read
        the works of Edgar Allan Poe will ever forget his thrilling and
        detailed story of a descent into the maelström?<a id="noteref_30"
        name="noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a> It bears
        the impress of close study, and is founded largely on recorded facts.
        Two brothers, the most daring fishermen of their coast, were
        accustomed to fish in closer proximity to the maelström than all the
        rest, because, although a desperate speculation, they would get more
        fish in a day than the others could at the distant fishing grounds in
        a week. The risk of life stood for labour, and courage for
        capital.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a terrible
        hurricane they were driven through the surf into the inner circle of
        the whirlpool, where (as is likely to be the case in actual fact) the
        wind nearly ceased, the surface of the water being lower than that of
        the surrounding ocean. <span class="tei tei-q">“If you have never
        been at sea in a heavy gale, you can form no idea of the confusion of
        mind occasioned by the wind and spray together. They blind, deafen,
        and strangle you, and take away all power of action or
        reflection.”</span> Now the two fishermen brothers were in a measure
        respited, as death-condemned felons in prison are allowed petty
        indulgences forbidden them while their doom is yet uncertain. Round
        and round the belt the vessel flew rather than floated, getting
        nearer and nearer to the fatal inner vortex, and making wild lurches
        towards the abyss. <span class="tei tei-q">“The boat appeared to be
        hanging, as if by magic, midway down, upon the interior surface of a
        funnel vast in circumference, prodigious in depth, and whose
        perfectly smooth sides might have been mistaken for ebony, but for
        the bewildering rapidity with which they spun round, and for the
        gleaming and ghastly radiance they shot forth as the rays of the full
        moon ... streamed in a flood of golden glory along the black walls,
        and far away down into the inmost recesses of the abyss.”</span>
        Round and round they swept in dizzying swings and jerks. Above and
        below them were whirling fragments of vessels, timbers, boxes,
        barrels, and trunks of trees. And now a hope arose from the
        recollection of one circumstance: that of the great variety of
        buoyant matter thrown up by the moskoe-strom on the coast of Lofoden,
        some articles were not disfigured or damaged at all. Further, light
        and cylindrical articles were the least likely to be absorbed into
        any watery vortex: for the last statement there are good scientific
        reasons. <span class="tei tei-q">“I,”</span> says the survivor,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“no longer hesitated what to do. I resolved
        to lash myself securely to the water-cask upon which I now held, to
        cut it loose from the counter, and to throw myself with it into the
        water. I attracted my brother’s attention by signs, pointed to the
        floating barrels that came near us, and did everything in my power to
        make him understand what I was about to do. I thought at length that
        he comprehended my design, but whether this was the case or not, he
        shook his head despairingly, and refused to move from his station by
        the ring-bolt. It was impossible to reach him; the emergency admitted
        of no delay; and so, with a bitter struggle, I resigned him to his
        fate, fastened myself to the cask by means of the lashings which
        secured it to the counter, and precipitated myself with it into the
        sea without another moment’s hesitation.”</span> The smack soon after
        made a few gyrations in rapid succession, then sank to the bottom for
        ever, bearing with it the unfortunate brother. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The barrel to which I was attached had sunk very little
        farther than half the distance between the bottom of the gulf and the
        spot at which I leaped overboard before a great change took place in
        the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page95">[pg 95]</span><a name=
        "Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>character of the
        whirlpool. The slope of the sides of the vast funnel became
        momentarily less and less steep. The gyrations of the whirl grew
        gradually less and less violent.”</span> By degrees the waters rose,
        and he found himself in full view of the shores of Lofoden, and above
        the spot where the pool of the moskoe-strom <span class=

        He was picked up by a boat; those on board were old mates and daily
        companions, but they knew him no more than they would have known a
        traveller from the spirit-land. His hair, which had been raven black
        the day before, was now as white as snow.</p>

        the appearance of a Gothic building with a number of arches. In the

        with tremendous violence, rushes up these chimneys, and flies,
        roaring furiously, to a height of full sixty feet. The moment the
        wave recedes, the vacuum beneath causes the wind to rush into the two
        apertures with a loud humming noise, which is heard at a considerable
        distance.</span></p>

        duller in character. In the Bay of Loango the waters appear of a deep

        floating microscopic algæ and to red coral bottoms. Sea water,
        concentrated in the salt marshes of the south of France by the heat
        of the sun, is also red: this is due to the presence of a red-shelled
        animal of microscopic size. These minute creatures do not appear till
        the salt water has attained a certain concentration, while they die
        when it has reached a further density. Navigators often traverse
        patches of green, red, white, or yellow-coloured water, their

        rapid way, when what appeared to be a vast sheet of phosphorus
        presented itself, floating on the waves, and occupying a great space
        ahead of the ship. The vessel having passed through this fiery mass,
        it was discovered that the light was occasioned by organised bodies
        swimming about in the sea at various depths around the ship. Those
        which were deepest in the water looked like red-hot balls, while
        those on the surface resembled cylinders of red-hot iron. Some of the
        latter were caught; they were found to vary in size from three to
        seven inches. All the exterior of the creatures bristled with long
        thick tubercles, shining like so many diamonds, and these seemed to
        be the principal seats of their luminosity. Inside also there
        appeared to be a multitude of oblong narrow glands, exhibiting a high
        degree of phosphoric power. The colour of these animals when in
        repose is an opal yellow, mixed with green; but on the slightest
        movement the animal exhibits a spontaneous contractile power, and
        assumes a luminous brilliancy, passing through various shades of
        deep-red, orange-green, and azure-blue.”</span> A ship plunging

        copper wire, insulated with gutta-percha, was submerged between

        countries of Europe was the first considerable success of its kind.
        To-day Great Britain is connected with the European continent by a
        dozen cables, and there are over 50,000 miles of submerged wires
        silently conveying their messages over the face of the globe. Thirty

        Stockbridge, Massachusetts, a rural village nook which lies calmly
        and peacefully cradled among the green Berkshire hills, a spot which
        would delight the eyes of a true artist. He was the son of a country
        pastor, who, in spite of a paltry stipend of a hundred and fifty
        pounds a year, and thanks to the scholastic advantages offered to
        every one in the United States, gave nine children a superior
        education. Several of these children distinguished themselves in
        after life, but none more than the subject of this

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While to this
        energetic man is due the actual success, it is to Professor Morse,
        who had said that <span class="tei tei-q">“telegraphic communication
        might with certainty be established across the Atlantic
        Ocean,”</span> and to an excellent Roman Catholic bishop, that the
        idea is to be fairly credited. Bishop Mullock, of Newfoundland, while
        lying becalmed in his yacht off Cape North, the extreme point of the
        province of Cape Breton, bethought himself how his poor neglected
        island might reap some advantage from being taken into the track of
        communication between Europe and America, for he saw that Nature had
        provided an easy approach to the mainland for a cable. Fired with the
        idea, he wrote to one of the St. John’s papers, and his letter is
        to-day a model of lucid explanation. About the same time Mr.
        Frederick N. Gisborne, a practical telegraph operator, promulgated
        the idea of connecting St. John’s with the mainland, and one evening
        interested Mr. Cyrus Field, then just retired from business on a
        competency, in his scheme. <span class="tei tei-q">“After he
        left,”</span> writes his brother, <span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Field
        took the globe which was standing in the library, and began to turn
        it over. It was while thus studying the globe that the idea first
        occurred to him that the telegraph might be carried further still,
        and be made to span the Atlantic Ocean.”</span> Maury, the
        distinguished marine scientist, and Professor Morse, had also come to
        the same conclusion, and at about the same time as had others in
        England. The history of the financial difficulties and ultimate
        triumphs connected with the inauguration of the first cable would not
        interest the reader; suffice it to say that half-a-dozen New York
        millionaires subscribed the first capital—a million and a half
        dollars. The cable across the Gulf of St. Lawrence was successfully
        laid in 1856, after one previous failure.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now Field
        began to clear the way by consulting the highest scientific
        authorities on both sides of the Atlantic. Was it possible to carry a
        cable across the ocean? If laid, would it be able to convey messages?
        The first query related to mechanical difficulties only, such as the
        depth of the ocean, the nature of the ocean bed, the influence of
        currents and winds. The second referred to pure science and the
        conditions under which the electric fluid acts—Would the lightning
        flash from shore to shore across an intervening waste of sea? The
        answer to the first question was supplied by Maury, who pointed out
        that between Ireland and Newfoundland the bottom of the sea formed a
        plateau, or elevated table-land, which, as he said, seemed to have
        been placed there especially for the purpose of supporting the wires
        of an electric telegraph, and protecting them from injury. Its slope,
        he said, was quite regular, gradually increasing from the shores of
        Newfoundland to the depth of from 1,500 to 2,000 fathoms as you
        approach the Irish coast. It was neither too deep nor too shallow:
        deep enough to protect the cable from danger by ships’ anchors,
        icebergs, and currents; shallow enough to secure that the wires
        should be readily lodged upon the bottom. From Professor Morse an
        equally satisfactory answer was obtained. He declared his faith in
        the undertaking as a practicable one: that it might, could, and would
        be achieved.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Company
        undertook to make a series of careful soundings to ascertain the
        exact nature of the ocean bottom over which the cable connecting
        Newfoundland with Ireland would have to be laid. Mr. Field applied
        for this purpose to the American Government, who immediately
        despatched the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Arctic</span></span>, under Lieutenant Berryman,
        on this useful and most necessary service. She sailed from New York
        on the 18th of July, 1856; and on the following day Mr. Field left in
        the steamship <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=

        the Atlantic Telegraph Company. The <span class=

        proceeded to St. John’s, and thence went <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        reaching the coast of Ireland, and clearly demonstrating, as the
        result of her survey, the existence of a great plateau under the
        ocean, extending all the way from the New World to the Old. To make
        assurance doubly sure, Mr. Field solicited the British Admiralty
        <span class="tei tei-q">“to make what further soundings might be
        necessary between Ireland and Newfoundland, and to verify those made
        by Lieutenant Berryman.”</span> In response to this appeal the

        telegraphic plateau—the elevated table-land which Providence had
        raised between the two continents—nowhere exceeded 2,500 fathoms, or
        15,000 feet. Such a depth is almost trivial compared with the
        enormous depths in other parts of the Atlantic, where you might hide
        from all human eyes the loftiest snow-clad peak of the Himalayas, yet
        no inconsiderable depth if you reflect that the peak of Teneriffe,
        were it here <span class="tei tei-q">“cast into the sea,”</span>
        would sink out of sight, island, mountain, and all; and even the
        coloured crest of Mont Blanc would rise but a few hundred feet above
        the waves. The single exception to this uniform depth occurs about
        200 miles off the Irish coast, where within an area of about a dozen
        miles the depth sinks from 550 to 1,750 fathoms. In 14° 48′ W., says
        Dayman, we have 550 fathoms rock, and in 150° 6′ W. we have 1,750
        fathoms ooze. In little more than ten miles of distance a change of
        depth takes place amounting to fully 7,200 feet. It was supposed that
        this tremendous declivity would be the chief point of danger in
        laying down the cable; and to remove, if possible, the anxiety which
        existed, Lieutenant Dayman made a further survey. The result showed
        that the dip was not a sudden one; the precipitous bank or submarine
        cliff turned out to be a gradual slope of nearly sixty miles. Over
        this long slope, said a writer in the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Times</span></span>,
        the difference between its greatest height and greatest depth is only
        8,760 feet, so that the average incline is, in round numbers, about
        145 feet per mile. A good gradient on a railway is now generally
        considered to be 1 in 100 feet, or about 53 feet in a mile; so that
        the incline on this supposed bank is only about three times that of
        an ordinary railway. It was found upon these surveys that the ocean
        bed consisted of a soft ooze, as soft as the moss which clings to old
        damp stone on the river’s brink. And of what does this ooze consist?
        The microscope revealed the astonishing fact that it is made up of
        myriads of shells, too minute to be discovered by the naked eye, yet
        each perfect in itself, unbroken and uninjured. These organisms live
        near the surface of the water, but in death sink down to the bottom,
        and there find a calm and peaceful resting-place. Well has it been
        said that a mighty work of life and death has for ages been going on
        in the tranquil bosom of ocean. Myriads upon myriads, ever since the
        morning of creation, have been falling—falling like snow-flakes, till
        their remains cover with a thick stratum of beautiful organisms the
        ocean bed. <span class="tei tei-q">“The bearing of this
        discovery,”</span> says Dr. Field, <span class="tei tei-q">“on the
        problem of a submarine telegraph was obvious. For it, too, was to lie
        on the ocean bed, beside and among those relics that had so long been
        drifting down upon the watery plain. And if these tiny shells slept
        there unharmed, surely an iron cord might rest there in safety. There
        were no swift currents down there; no rushing waves agitated that
        sunless sea. There the waters moved not, and there might rest the
        great nerve that was to pass from <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>continent to continent. And so far as injury
        from the surrounding elements was concerned, there it might remain,
        whispering the thoughts of successive generations of men, till the
        sea should give up its dead.”</span> Everything showed that the
        project of an Atlantic cable was feasible. All that remained was to
        raise the capital necessary for its development. But this could be
        done only by the formation of a large and influential company, the
        enterprise having outgrown the resources of Mr. Field and his little
        band of New York merchants. While engaged in submitting his scheme to
        the consideration of the capitalists of London, Mr. Field found
        counsel and encouragement from many men distinguished in the world of
        science, and among his principal supporters had the good fortune to
        rank Glass and Elliot, now so well known as manufacturers of
        sea-cables, and the celebrated engineers whose names are associated
        with the scientific marvels of the age—Brett, Bidder, Robert
        Stephenson, and Brunel. The last-named was then building the colossal
        ship afterwards called the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Great Eastern</span></span>; and one day taking
        Mr. Field down to see her gigantic hull as it lay in the yard at
        Blackwall, he exclaimed—and, as results have proved,
        prophetically—<span class="tei tei-q">“There is the ship to lay your
        Atlantic cable!”</span></p><a name="illo_115" id="illo_115" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Atlantic
        Telegraph Company was formed; and 2,500 miles of cable were
        manufactured and stowed on board the English naval vessel
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Agamemnon</span></span> and the United States
        ship <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Niagara</span></span>. It was on the evening of
        August 7th, 1857, that the squadron sailed; and according to
        arrangement the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Niagara</span></span> at once began to pay out
        the cable very slowly; but before five miles had been accomplished
        the heavy shore end of the cable got entangled with the machinery
        through the carelessness of one of the men in charge, and parted. The
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Niagara</span></span> put back, and the cable
        was <span class="tei tei-q">“under run”</span> the whole distance. At
        last the end was raised from the water and <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“spliced”</span> to the gigantic coil, and as it dropped
        safely to its resting-place among the <span class="tei tei-q">“salt
        sea ooze”</span> the noble ship once more went on her way. Saturday,
        we are told, was a day of beautiful weather. The squadron made good
        progress at a rate of from four to five miles an hour, and the cable
        was paid out at a speed somewhat exceeding that of the ship, to allow
        for any irregularities of surface on the bottom of the sea. Meantime
        a constant communication was kept up with the land. Every moment the
        electric fluid flashed between ship and shore. Not only did the
        electricians wire back to Valentia the progress they were making, but
        the officers on board sent messages to their friends in America to go
        out by the steamer from Liverpool. The very heavens seemed to regard
        the enterprise with favour. All went merrily as a marriage bell.
        Without a kink the coil came up from the vessel’s hold, and unwinding
        easily, passed over the stern into the sea. Once or twice, however, a
        momentary alarm was caused by the cable being thrown <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>off the wheels, an accident due to the
        insufficient width and depth of the sheaves and to the fact that they
        were filled with tar, which hardened in the air. This defect was
        remedied in later expeditions. Still it worked well, and as long as
        the terrible brakes withheld their iron grasp might work through to
        the end. On the following day, Sunday, the course of affairs was not
        less smooth; and on Monday the expedition was upwards of 200 miles
        from land. The shallow water of the coast had been safely traversed.
        The ships had passed over the submarine declivity which has been
        already described, and had reached the deeper waters of the Atlantic,
        where the cable sank to a depth of not less than 2,000 fathoms. Still
        the iron cord buried itself in the profound silence, and every
        instant the flash of light in the telegraph room recorded the
        continuous passage of the mysterious electric current. About four
        o’clock on Tuesday morning, however, a sudden interruption occurred.
        It seems from the published narrative that the cable was running cut
        fully at the rate of six miles an hour, while the ship was making
        only four. To check this waste, the engineer applied the brakes very
        firmly, with the effect of stopping the machine. Hence a heavy strain
        told on the submerged portion of the cable. The stern of the ship was
        down in the trough of the sea, and as it rose upward on the swell the
        pressure became too great, and the cable parted. Instantly a cry of
        grief and dismay ran through the ship. She was checked in her onward
        career, and in five minutes all gathered on deck with feelings which
        can be better imagined than described. One who was present
        wrote:—<span class="tei tei-q">“The unbidden tear started to many a
        manly eye. The interest taken in the enterprise by all—every one,
        officers and men—exceeded anything I ever saw, and there is no wonder
        that there should have been so much emotion at our failure.”</span>
        Captain Hudson says:—<span class="tei tei-q">“It made all hands of us
        through the day like a household or family which had lost their
        dearest friend, for officers and men had been deeply interested in
        the success of the enterprise.”</span> The cable broke in 2,000
        fathoms water, when about 330 nautical miles were laid, at a distance
        of 280 miles from Valentia. This was the first of a series of
        disappointments, ending, however, in eventual triumph.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same vessels
        sailed again in June of the next year, and as arranged before
        starting, reached a point of junction in mid-stream, where the ends
        of the two cables were spliced, and the ships parted, the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Agamemnon</span></span> steering for Valentia,
        and the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Niagara</span></span> for Trinity Bay,
        Newfoundland. Both vessels arrived at their ports of destination on
        August 5th, and the fact of the completion of the enterprise was for
        the first time <span class="tei tei-q">“cabled”</span> under the wide
        Atlantic two days later, to the great rejoicing, it may fairly be
        said, of two worlds. Congratulatory messages were flashed from either
        end, and success seemed secured. Alas! less than a month later all
        communication ceased; the electric current would not pass through the
        great wire-rope; there was a leakage somewhere. But it had been shown
        conclusively that messages <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">could</span></span> be transmitted under the
        given conditions. This was something.</p>

        the financial arrangements connected with a new attempt, which was

        though the cable measured 2,700 miles, a visitor to the mammoth ship
        was at first unaware of its being on board! Here is the account given
        by a writer who went to see the ship and its novel cargo. Its details
        are interesting. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is time,”</span> he
        says, after a general survey of the wonders of the huge
        vessel—<span class="tei tei-q">“it is time we should look after what
        we have mainly come to see—the telegraph cable. To our intense
        astonishment we beheld it—nowhere, although informed that there are
        nearly 2,000 miles of it already on board, and that the remaining
        piece, which is long enough to stretch from Land’s End to John o’
        Groat’s, is in course of shipment. We walk up and down on the deck of
        the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Great
        Eastern</span></span> without seeing this chain which is to bind
        together the Old World and the New, and it is only on having the
        place pointed out to us that we find out where the cable
        lies.”</span> The writer then describes the process of taking it on
        board:—<span class="tei tei-q">“On the side opposite to where we
        landed, deep below the deck of our giant, is moored a vessel
        surmounted by a timber structure resembling a house, and from this
        vessel the wonderful telegraph cable is drawn silently into the
        immense womb of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Great Eastern</span></span>. The work is done so
        quietly and noiselessly, by means of a small steam-engine, that we
        scarcely notice it. Indeed, were it not pointed out to us, we would
        never think that that little iron cord, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">about an inch in
        diameter</span></span>, which is sliding over a few rollers and
        through a wooden table, is a thing of world-wide fame—a thing which
        may influence the life of whole nations, nay, which may affect the
        march of civilisation. Following the direction in which the iron rope
        goes, we now come to the most marvellous sight.... We find ourselves
        in a little wooden cabin, and look down over a railing at the side
        into an immense cavern below. This cavern is one of the three
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘tanks’</span> in which the two-thousand-mile
        cable is finding a temporary home. The passive agent of electricity
        comes creeping in here in a beautiful silent manner, and is deposited
        in coils, layer above layer. It is almost dark at the immense depth
        below, and we can only dimly discern the human figures through whose
        hands the coil passes to its bed. Suddenly, however, the men begin
        singing. They intone a low, plaintive song of the sea, something like
        Kingsley’s</span></p>

        Atlantic telegraph cable is haunting us like a dream. In vain that
        our guide conducts us all over the big ship, through miles of
        galleries, passages, staircases, and promenades; through gorgeous
        saloons full of mirrors, marbles, paintings, and upholstery, made

        sundry mishaps, she turned her mighty prow towards the sunset, and
        proceeded on her stately way. All went well until the 29th of July,
        when a little after noon a new cry of alarm was raised. And well it
        might be, for the insulation was completely destroyed and the
        electric current overflowing uselessly into the sea. As the faulty
        piece had gone overboard, it was necessary once more to reverse the
        vessel’s course, and haul in the cable until the defective part was
        recovered. This was a difficult task, for they were in water two
        miles deep. Difficulties did not, however, daunt the pioneers of this
        great enterprise, and after working all the afternoon, the injured
        cable was got on board about ten o’clock at night. It was at once
        stowed away, and the next morning, Sunday, was welcomed with an eager
        feeling of relief and delight after the suspense of the preceding
        four-and-twenty hours. On Monday the miles of cable which had been
        hauled up and were coiled in huge heaps upon the deck were closely
        examined to discover the origin of the mischief. This was soon
        detected. Near the end a piece of wire was thrust through the very
        core, as if driven into it. The recurrence of such a mishap actually
        suggested suspicions of treachery. It was observed that the same gang
        of workmen were in the tank as at the time of the first fault. Mr.
        Canning sent for the men, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>showing them the cable and the wire, asked for
        an explanation. All replied that it must have been done
        intentionally, and regretted that there was a traitor among them—the
        unknown traitor, of course, being one of those who thus expressed
        their sorrow. It seemed difficult to believe that any person could be
        base enough to plot in this stealthy way against the success of a
        beneficent enterprise, but such a thing had been done before in a
        cable in the North Sea, when the perpetrator of the crime was
        discovered and punished. In the present case there were not wanting
        motives to prompt the commission of such an act. The fall in the
        stock, we are told, on the London Exchange, caused by a loss of the
        cable, could hardly be less than half a million sterling. It was,
        however, found impossible to fix the deed on any one, for nothing was
        proved; and the instigator and the perpetrator both remaining
        unknown, of course a painful feeling of suspicion was left in the
        minds of Mr. Field and his colleagues. They saw that they must be on
        their guard; and it was agreed, therefore, that the gentlemen on
        board should take turn in keeping watch in the tank. The <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Great
        Eastern</span></span> continued her voyage, and for three days,
        during which they accomplished 500 miles, no further trouble
        occurred. A few days later, however, a defect was found in the cable,
        and it became necessary to haul in a short portion of that last paid
        out. Unfortunately the machinery proved too weak for the purpose, and
        a breeze springing up, the cable chafed until it snapped right
        asunder. With one bound it flew through the stoppers, and plunged
        into the sea. <span class="tei tei-q">“The shock of the
        instant,”</span> Dr. Russell tells us, <span class="tei tei-q">“was
        as sharp as the snapping of the cable itself,”</span> so great was
        the disappointment felt on board.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The apparently
        wild attempt was immediately made to <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">recover</span></span>
        the cable. It was settled that the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Great
        Eastern</span></span> should steam to windward, and eastward of the
        position she occupied when the cable went down, lower a grapnel, and
        slowly drift across the track in which the lost treasure was supposed
        to be lying. So the leviathan ship stood away some thirteen or
        fourteen miles, and then lay-to in smooth water. The grapnel
        consisted of two five-armed anchors, of several hundredweight, one of
        which was shackled and secured to wire rope, of which there were five
        miles on board, and committed to the deep. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Away slipped the rope, yard after yard, fathom after
        fathom; ocean, like the horse-leech’s daughter still crying for
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘more’</span> and <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘more,’</span> still descending into the black waste of
        waters. One thousand fathoms—still more! One thousand five hundred
        fathoms—still more! Two thousand fathoms—more, still more! Two
        thousand five hundred fathoms (15,000 feet)—aye, that will do; the
        grapnel has reached the bed of the Atlantic; the search has
        commenced.”</span> Next morning these efforts bore fruit, for the
        great sea-serpentine cable was caught, and raised seven hundred
        fathoms (4,200 feet), towards the surface, unhappily to again fall to
        the bottom. A second attempt resulted in raising it a mile and a
        half, when a swivel gave way, and it again sank to the bottom. These
        experiments had used up a considerable quantity of the wire rope, and
        every expedient had to be adopted to patch up and strengthen the
        fishing apparatus, which gave full employment to the mechanics on
        board. Great forge-fires were made on deck, which at night illumined
        the ocean for a distance round, and helped to make a striking and
        effective scene. A third and fourth attempt was made to raise the
        cable; but in spite of the indomitable perseverance of Field and his
        associates, without success, and the bows of the great ship were
        sorrowfully directed towards home.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In spite of these
        failures no abatement of public confidence in the eventual success of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span><a name="Pg106"
        id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the enterprise was shown on the
        return of the expedition to England. Nearly a quarter of a million
        pounds sterling was subscribed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">privately</span></span> towards the next
        attempt, and when the subscription books were thrown open to the
        public, the whole capital required was furnished in a fortnight. Some
        minor improvements were introduced in the successful 1866 cable;
        among other points, it was galvanised.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the day
        arrived for the final great effort, the undertaking was inaugurated
        solemnly by special prayer and supplication. Dr. Field says of that
        moment:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Was there ever a fitter place or a fitter hour for
        prayer than here, in the presence of the great sea to which they were
        about to commit their lives and their precious trust? The first
        expedition ever sent forth had been consecrated by prayer. On that
        very spot, nine years before, all heads were uncovered and all forms
        bent low at the solemn words of supplication; and there had the Earl
        of Carlisle—since gone to his honoured grave—cheered them on with
        high religious hopes, describing the ships which were sent forth on
        such a mission as <span class="tei tei-q">‘beautiful upon the waters
        as were the feet upon the mountains of them that publish the gospel
        of peace.’</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Full of such a spirit, officers and directors assembled
        at Valentia on the day before the expedition sailed, and held a
        religious service. It was a scene long to be remembered. There were
        men of the closet and men of the field, men of science and men of
        action, men pale with study and men bronzed by sun and storm. All was
        hushed and still. Not a single gun broke the deep silence of the
        hour, as, with humble hearts, they bowed together before the God and
        Father of all. They were about to <span class="tei tei-q">‘go down to
        the sea in ships,’</span> and they felt their dependence on a higher
        Power. Their preparations were complete. All that man could do was
        done. They had exhausted every resource of science and skill. The
        issue now remained with Him who controls the winds and waves.
        Therefore was it most fit that before embarking they should thus
        commit themselves to Him who alone spreadeth out the heavens and
        ruleth the raging sea.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“In all this there is something of antique stamp,
        something which makes us think of the sublime men of an earlier and
        better time: of the Pilgrim Fathers kneeling on the deck of their
        little ship at Leyden, as they were about to seek a refuge and a home
        in the forests of the New World, and of Columbus and his companions
        celebrating a solemn service before their departure from Spain. And
        so with labour and with prayer was this great expedition prepared to
        sail once more from the shores of Ireland, bearing the hopes of
        science and of civilisation, with courage and skill looking out from
        the bows of the ship across the stormy waters, and a religious faith,
        like that of Columbus, standing at the helm.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“On Friday the 13th of July, 1866, the fleet finally bade
        adieu to the land. Was Friday an unlucky day? Some of the sailors
        thought so, and would have been glad to leave a day before or after.
        But Columbus sailed on Friday, and discovered the New World on
        Friday; and so this expedition put to sea on Friday, and, as a good
        Providence would have it, reached land on the other side of the
        Atlantic on the same day of the week! As the ships disappeared below
        the horizon, Mr. Glass and Mr. Varley went up on their watch-tower,
        not to look, but to listen for the first voice from the sea. The
        ships bore away for the buoy where lay the end of the shore
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107"
        id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>line, but the weather was thick
        and foggy, with frequent bursts of rain, and they could not see far
        on the water. For an hour or two the ships went sailing round and
        round, like sea-gulls in search of prey. At length the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Medway</span></span>
        caught sight of the buoy tossing on the waves, and firing a signal
        gun, bore down straight upon it. The cable was soon hauled up from
        its bed, 100 fathoms deep, and lashed to the stern of the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Great
        Eastern</span></span>; and the watchers on shore, who had been
        waiting with some impatience, saw the first flash, and Varley read,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Got the shore-end all right; going to make
        the splice.’</span> Then all was still, and they knew that that
        delicate operation was going on. Quick, nimble hands tore off the
        covering from a foot of the shore-end and of the main cable till they
        came to the core, then swiftly unwinding the copper wires they laid
        them together as closely and carefully as a silken braid. Then this
        delicate child of the sea was wrapped in swaddling clothes, covered
        up with many coatings of gutta-percha and hempen rope and strong iron
        wires, the whole bound round and round with heavy bands, and the
        splicing was complete. Signals are now sent through the whole cable
        on board the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Great Eastern</span></span> and back to the
        telegraph house at Valentia, and the whole length, 2,440 nautical
        miles, is reported perfect, and so with light hearts they bear away.
        It is nearly three o’clock. As they turn to the west, the following
        is the <span class="tei tei-q">‘order of battle’</span>: the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Terrible</span></span> goes ahead, standing off
        on the starboard bow, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Medway</span></span> is on the port, and the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Albany</span></span> on the starboard quarter.
        From that hour the voyage was a steady progress. Indeed, it was
        almost monotonous from its uninterrupted success. The weather was
        variable, alternating with sunshine and rain, fogs and squalls; but
        there was no heavy sea to interrupt their course, and the distance
        run was about the same from day to day, as the following table will
        show:—</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This table shows
        the speed of the ship to have been exactly according to the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“running time”</span> fixed before she left
        England. On the last voyage it was thought that she had once or twice
        run too fast, and thus exposed the cable to danger. It was therefore
        decided to go slowly but surely. Holding her back to this moderate
        pace, her average speed from the time the splice was made until they
        saw land was a little less than five nautical miles an hour, while
        the cable was paid out at an average of not quite five and half
        miles. Thus the total slack was about eleven per cent., showing that
        the cable was laid almost in a straight line, allowing for the swells
        and hollows at the bottom of the sea. <span class=

        arranged with the Admiral. The <span class=

        At twenty minutes after 4 p.m. the <span class=

        came on our port side, quite close, and Captain Bunce, sending the

        which were heartily returned by the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Great

        The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=

        immediately to Heart’s Content, clear the N.E. side of the harbour of
        shipping, and place a boat with a red flag for Captain Anderson to
        steer to for anchorage. Just before dinner we saw on the southern
        horizon, distant about ten miles, an iceberg, probably the one that
        the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=

        apparently about fifty or sixty feet in height. The fog came on very
        thickly about 8 p.m., and between that and 10 we were constantly
        exchanging guns and burning blue lights with the <span class=

        about ENE., distant about four miles. Later in the night Captain

        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Great
        Eastern</span></span> he would send the surveyor, Mr. Robinson, R.N.,
        who came up in the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Niger</span></span>, aboard of us; and about 3
        the engines were slowed, and the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Terrible</span></span> shortly afterwards came
        alongside with that officer. Catalina Light, at the entrance of
        Trinity Bay, had been made out three hours before this, and the loom
        of the coast had also been seen. Fog still prevailing! According to
        Mr. Robinson’s account, if they had got one clear day in seven at the
        entrance of Trinity Bay they considered themselves fortunate. Here we
        are now (6 a.m.) within ten miles of Heart’s Content, and we can
        scarcely see more than a ship’s length. The <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Niger</span></span>,
        however, is ahead, and her repeated guns tell us where we are with
        accuracy. Good fortune follows us, and scarcely has 8 o’clock
        arrived, when the massive curtain of fog raises itself gradually from
        both sides of Trinity Bay, disclosing to us the entrance of Heart’s
        Content, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Albany</span></span> making for the harbour, the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Margaretta Stevenson</span></span>, surveying
        vessel, steaming out to meet us, the pre-arranged pathway all marked
        with buoys by Mr. T. H. Kerr, R.N., and a whole fleet of fishing
        boats fishing at the entrance. We could now plainly see that Heart’s
        Content, so far as its capabilities permitted, was prepared to
        welcome us. The British and American flags floated from the church
        and telegraph station and other buildings. We had dressed ship, fired
        a salute, and given three cheers, and Captain Commerell, of H.M.S.
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Terrible</span></span>, was soon on board to
        congratulate us on our success. At 9 o’clock, ship’s time, just as we
        had cut the cable and made arrangements for the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Medway</span></span>
        to lay the shore end, a message arrived, giving us the concluding
        words of a leader in this morning’s <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Times</span></span>:
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘It is a great work, a glory to our age and
        nation, and the men who have achieved it deserve to be honoured
        amongst the benefactors of their race.’</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Treaty of peace signed between Prussia and
        Austria!’</span> It was now time for the chief engineer, Mr. Canning,
        to make preparations for splicing on board the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Medway</span></span>.
        Accompanied by Mr. Good, M.P., Mr. Clifford, Mr. Willoughby Smith,
        and Messrs. Temple and Deane, he went on board; the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Terrible</span></span> and <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Niger</span></span>
        having sent their paddle-box boats to assist. Shortly afterwards the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Great
        Eastern</span></span> steamed into the harbour and anchored on the
        NE. side, and was quickly surrounded by boats laden with visitors.
        Mr. Cyrus Field had gone on shore before the <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Great Eastern</span></span> had left the offing,
        with a view of telegraphing to St. John’s to hire a vessel to repair
        the cable unhappily broken between Cape Ray, in Newfoundland, and
        Cape North, in Breton Island. Before a couple of hours the shore end
        will be landed, and it is impossible to conceive a finer day for
        effecting this our final operation. To-morrow Heart’s Content will
        awaken to the fact that it is a highly-favoured place in the world’s
        esteem, the western landing-place of that marvel of electric
        communication with the eastern hemisphere which is now happily, and
        we hope finally, established.”</span> The foregoing simple record
        tells the great story of this memorable voyage. In England the
        progress of the expedition was known from day to day, but on the
        American side of the ocean all was uncertainty. Some had gone to
        Heart’s Content hoping to witness the arrival of the fleet, but not
        so many as the year before, for the memory of the last failure was
        too fresh, and they feared another disappointment. But still a
        faithful few were there who kept their daily watch. The
        correspondents of the American papers reported only a long and
        anxious suspense till that morning when the first ship was seen in
        the offing. And now the hull of the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Great
        Eastern</span></span> looms up all glorious in that morning sky. They
        are coming! Instantly all was wild excitement on shore. Boats put off
        to row towards the fleet. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Albany</span></span> was the first to round the
        point and enter the bay. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Terrible</span></span> came close behind. The
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Medway</span></span> stopped an hour or two to
        join on the heavy shore end, while the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Great
        Eastern</span></span>, gliding calmly in as if she had done nothing
        remarkable, dropped her anchor in front of the telegraph house,
        having trailed behind her a chain of two thousand miles, to bind the
        Old World to the New. That same afternoon, as soon as the shore end
        was landed, Captain Anderson and the officers of the fleet went in a
        body to the little church of Heart’s Content to render thanks for the
        success of the expedition. A sermon was preached on the text,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“There shall be no more sea,”</span> and all
        joined in the sublime prayers and thanksgivings of the Church of
        England. Thus the voyage ended as it began.</p><a name="illo_124" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although the
        expedition reached Newfoundland on Friday the 27th, yet as the cable
        across the Gulf of St. Lawrence was broken, the news was not received
        in New York until the 29th. It was early Sunday morning, before the
        Sabbath bells had rung their call to prayer, that the tidings came.
        The first announcement was brief—<span class="tei tei-q">“Heart’s
        Content, July 27th.—We arrived here at nine o’clock this morning. All
        well. Thank God the cable is laid, and is in perfect working
        order.—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">Cyrus W. Field.</span></span>”</span> Soon
        followed the despatch to the Associated Press, giving the details of
        the voyage, and ending with a just tribute to the skill and devotion
        of all who had contributed to its success. Said Mr. Field:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I cannot find words suitable to convey my
        admiration for the men who have so ably conducted the nautical,
        engineering, and electrical departments of this enterprise, amidst
        difficulties which must be seen to be appreciated; in fact, all on
        board of the telegraph fleet, and all connected with the enterprise,
        have done their best to have the cable made and laid in a perfect
        condition.”</span> Other despatches followed in quick succession,
        giving the latest events of the war in Europe. All this confirmed the
        great triumph, and filled the breasts of many with wonder and
        gratitude that Sabbath day as they went up to the house of God and
        rendered thanks to Him who is Lord of the earth and sea.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pliny says that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Nature is nowhere more perfect than in her
        smaller works.”</span> How gradually, yet beautifully, do the lower
        forms of life ascend to the higher! Here we may well remember the
        following: Scientific naturalists, men of logical minds arranging the
        facts of Nature with methodical and almost mathematical precision,
        have distributed the forms of animal life into divisions, classes,
        orders, families, genera, and species. These divisions, however
        convenient, are, it must be noted, merely of human invention, subject
        to alteration as knowledge increases—subject even to positive
        mistake. Linnæus tells us that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Natura non facit saltus</span></span>—Nature
        does not jump or leap from one stage to another, but passes almost
        insensibly, life merging into other life.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A word commonly
        employed in connection with the lower forms of marine life also
        requires some passing notice. The term <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">zoophyte</span></span>,
        derived from two Greek words signifying respectively <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">animal</span></span>
        and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">plant</span></span>, would seem appropriate
        enough in describing generally many of the organisms found in the
        great deep. But the term as now used signifies an animal, and nothing
        but one, however plant-like it may appear.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The simplest forms
        of marine animal life are found in the extensive group known as the
        Protozoa. Varied as they are, they may be generally described as
        devoid of articulate skeleton, or nervous system; they are animals, a
        large part of them microscopic, with a vegetative existence.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“In their obscure and blind life,”</span>
        says Figuier, <span class="tei tei-q">“have they consciousness or
        instinct? Do they know what takes place at the three-thousandth part
        of an inch from their microscopic bodies? To the Creator alone does
        the knowledge of this mystery belong.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The limits of this
        work preclude the possibility of details. To the division Protozoa
        belong the sponges, already described, the Rhizopods (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Rhizopoda</span></span>), <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">root-footed</span></span> animals, and the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Infusoria</span></span>, animalcules so small
        that a drop of water may contain millions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Rhizopods are
        found both in fresh and salt water, but the marine forms are by far
        the more numerous. They are simply minute lumps of diaphanous jelly,
        the quantity of matter in them being so infinitesimal, and their
        transparency so great, that the eye, assisted by the powers of the
        microscope, can only take cognisance of them by the most careful
        arrangement of light. But for all that, they are known to have feet
        or feelers, to have digestive apparatus—some of them being, for their
        size, quite voracious feeders—which may be seen stuffed with
        microscopic <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">algæ</span></span>, or sea-weeds. It is believed
        that they are multiplied by parting with portions of their bodies,
        which become separate beings.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Reticulosa</span></span>, or <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Foraminifera</span></span>, form an order of
        this group. They are small calcareous <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>shells, as a rule, nearly invisible to the naked
        eye, and enclosing, or once having enclosed, a living organism. The
        sand of the sea-shore is often one-half composed of them. M.
        d’Orbigny found in three grammes (forty-six grains troy) of sand from
        the Antilles no less than 440,000 of these minute shells. Ehrenberg,
        the German microscopist, was once invited by the Prussian Government
        to assist in tracing the robbery of a special case of wine. It had
        been packed in sand only found in an ancient sea-board of Germany,
        and from this fact and knowledge of locality the thief was detected.
        The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Foraminifera</span></span>, small as they are,
        have helped to form enormous deposits, obstruct navigation in gulfs
        and straits, and fill up ports, as may be seen at Alexandria. In
        various geological strata they are found; they exist in immense
        quantities in the chalk cliffs of this country. In the Paris chalk
        their remains are so abundant that a block of little more than a
        cubic yard has been computed to contain <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">three thousand
        millions</span></span>! <span class="tei tei-q">“As,”</span> says
        Figuier, <span class="tei tei-q">“the chalk from these quarries has
        served to build Paris, as well as the towns and villages of the
        surrounding departments, it may be said that Paris, and other great
        centres of population which adjoin it, are built with the shells of
        these microscopic animals.”</span></p><a name="illo_127" id=

        collected at a great depth was found to contain 116 species; in the

        different species. The very largest kinds can hardly be seen by the
        naked eye. They are generally nearly colourless, but some of them are
        nevertheless green, blue, red, brown, and even blackish. Some of

        the sea are, there can be no doubt, much more numerous than those of
        the earth. Charles Darwin has remarked that our terrestrial forests
        do not maintain nearly so many living beings as do marine forests in
        the very bosom of the ocean. Its surface and its depths, its plains
        and its mountains, its valleys and precipices, teem with organisms,
        the like of which have no counterpart on the land, and which are only
        partly understood to-day, although the invention and adoption of the
        aquarium have greatly facilitated the study of them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many years ago Dr.
        Milne-Edwards, in a voyage round the coast of Sicily, employed a
        diver’s apparatus to enable him to descend and examine the bottom of
        the sea. It included a metallic casque and helmet, with visor or
        window of glass fitting closely by means of water-tight packing round
        the neck. It communicated with an air-pump above by a flexible tube;
        the diver had a rope attached by which he could be hoisted
        immediately, and a signal cord to give alarm in case of need; he wore
        heavy lead shoes, which gave him steadiness and enabled him to
        maintain his upright position in the water. Milne-Edwards made the
        descent in several fathoms of water, and with perfect safety. Ariel’s
        song had not to be applied to him:—</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        safely and successfully to examine in the most hidden recesses and

        of which had been hitherto hidden from the scientific world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The invention, or
        introduction rather, of the salt-water aquarium enables any one
        nowadays to study in comfort and at leisure the habits and
        peculiarities of marine animals. There is a drawing extant of an
        aquarium bearing the date 1742. Sir John Graham Dalyell, a well-known
        author, had a modest one early in this century. A sea-anemone taken
        from the sea in 1828, and placed in this glass tank, was, according
        to his biographer, alive and well in 1873; so that M. Figuier in
        claiming its first suggestion for M. Charles des Moulins is wrong.
        The fact is that the ancients kept, not for scientific, but for
        gastronomic purposes, fish and molluscs in tanks, and fed and studied
        their habits and needs in order to fit them for the table. These were
        practical aquaria.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">M. des Moulins,
        however, and, in our own country, Gosse and Warington, deserve full
        credit for advocating the establishment of these beautiful sources of
        rational pleasure and improvement, and for showing how they might
        best be kept in working order. To Des Moulins is also due the
        proposition that the animal life therein required the presence of
        vegetable life to keep it in natural condition. In the fresh-water
        aquarium duckweed was found to act efficiently, and a similar idea is
        now adopted in regard to marine plants in the salt-water aquarium.
        Sea-weeds do not usually bear transplanting, but sea water is so
        impregnated with seeds or germs, that by placing a few stones or
        rocks in the tank a crop of marine vegetation is ensured.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our own
        fish-houses at the Zoological Gardens were first opened in 1853,
        while those of the French Acclimatisation Society in the Bois de
        Boulogne were inaugurated in 1861. Now almost every capital possesses
        one on a grand scale. That at Naples is especially noted. At the
        Continental fishery exhibitions, held at Amsterdam, The Hague,
        Boulogne, Havre, Arcachon, &amp;c., temporary aquaria always form
        part of the attractions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The dimensions of
        the great aquarium at Brighton are as follows: Its area is 716 feet
        by 100 feet, the great tank alone containing 110,000 gallons of
        water, and having a plate glass front 130 feet long, through which
        the habits of very large fish may be studied. The rock-work of the
        tanks is artificial, and admirably adapted to give shelter to the
        fish and crustaceans which disport in them. The management of a large
        aquarium involves constant care, and it is quite possible to kill its
        inhabitants by too frequently changing the water—by over-kindness, in
        fact.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The aquaria at
        Brighton and the Crystal Palace are very differently constructed and
        managed. At the former there is no actual circulation of water from
        one tank to another, but <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg
        115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>it
        can, if necessary, be renewed from the sea; the mass of the water in
        the reserve tanks is small as compared with that in the show tanks,
        and aëration is effected by pumping air into the tanks through tubes
        of large diameter. At the Crystal Palace aquarium a constant
        circulation is maintained from one tank to another; the bulk of water
        in the reservoir is five times as much as that in the show tanks,
        while aëration is accomplished by carrying a main over their entire
        length, from which, under pressure, a small stream of water pours
        from a tap into each, breaking the surface of the water, and carrying
        down to the bottom of the tanks and distributing over the body of
        their contents myriads of minute bubbles of air, which present an
        enormous oxydising surface to the water, rendering it bright and
        sparkling. It does not answer to change the water too constantly,
        while some obnoxious specimens, like the flat-fish, foul it greatly,
        the remedy for which is found in putting animals in who in the
        economy of Nature act as scavengers. Various small animals have to be
        supplied as food for the larger ones. <span class="tei tei-q">“As the
        animal life and vegetable life mutually support each other, the kind
        of material necessary for maintaining the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘compensating system’</span> must be watchfully supplied.
        Mr. W. R. Hughes, of Birmingham, recommends the growth of sea lettuce
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alva
        latissima</span></span>) in tanks, as suitable both for oxygenating
        the water and for food for the fishes; the stock plants being
        introduced in the autumn months, when they are loaded with
        spores.”</span> The writer of the article in the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Encyclopædia Britannica,”</span> from which most of the
        above is taken, ventures to hope that the aquarium may become useful
        in a practical sense, and may determine many questions in regard to
        fish life and growth concerning which we are ignorant to-day.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“It would,”</span> says he, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“tend to the better regulation of our fisheries and to
        the augmentation of our food supplies, if we knew as much about the
        herring or the haddock as we do about the salmon.”</span> It is well
        known that fish, valuable as food, are too often captured at improper
        seasons and in a wasteful manner.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Passing on to
        higher forms of animal life, the polyps and acalephæ of the older
        authors, now classified as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        a superior organisation to those lately under notice. Regarded
        generally, their bodies are soft and gelatinous, they possess
        alimentary canals and digestive apparatus, and in nearly all cases
        the sexes are separate, generation being sometimes sexual and
        sometimes by gemmation or budding. This brief introduction to the
        subject must be taken only in a general, not a special sense, for
        there are numerous exceptions to be found among the animals
        classified as Cœlenterata.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The sub-kingdom Cœlenterata naturally divides itself
        into two groups—that of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Actinozoa</span></span>. The fresh-water hydra
        will serve as an example of the first, and the common sea-anemone of
        the second group. The essential difference between the two is, that
        in the former the stomachal cavity is not separated from the general
        cavity of the body, and the reproductive buds are external; while in
        the latter the stomachal cavity is let down, as it were, as a
        partially-closed sac, into the general cavity of the body, and the
        reproductive buds make their appearance between the walls of the
        general cavity of the alimentary or stomachal sac, and consequently
        internally. But in both there is a free communication between these
        two cavities—a communication obvious in the Hydrozoa, and which may
        be often verified in the case of the sea-anemones, by the young
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116"

        order (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        having a disc, more or less convex above, resembling a mushroom or
        expanded umbrella, the edges of the umbrella, as well as the mouth
        and suckers, commonly having tentacula, or feelers, and cilia. Taken
        from the sea, a Medusa weighing fifty ounces will rapidly dissolve
        away to a few grains of solid matter. These floating umbrellas or
        mushrooms, as they might be termed, are of many forms, but they are
        all to be counted among the most beautiful works of the Creator.
        Sometimes the animal is transparent as crystal, sometimes opaline,
        now of a delicate rose or azure-blue colour, now yellow, now violet,

        containing much water, so that we can scarcely comprehend how they
        resist the agitation of the waves and the force of the currents; the
        waves, however, float without hurting them, the tempest scatters
        without killing them. When the sea retires, or they are withdrawn
        from their native waters, their substance dissolves, the animal is
        decomposed, they are reduced to nothing; if the sun is strong this
        disorganisation occurs in the twinkling of an eye, so to
        speak.”</span> If they are touched ever so lightly while swimming,
        they contract their tentacula, fold up their umbrella, and sink into
        the depths of the sea. At one period of the year the Medusæ are
        charged with numbers of minute eggs, which are suspended in
        festoons—crystalline roes they might be termed—from their bodies, and
        which in due time become living organisms.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After all, it is
        to the poets we must go if we would describe the beauties of Nature
        aright. Michelet, speaking of the Medusa, says:—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why was this name, of terrible associations, given to a
        creature so charming? Often have I had my attention arrested by these
        castaways, which we see so often on the shore. They are small, about
        the size of my hand, but singularly pretty, of soft light shades, of
        an opal-white, where it lost itself as in a cloud of tentacles; a
        crown of tender lilies—the wind had overturned it; its crown of lilac
        hair floated about, and the delicate umbel, that is, its body proper,
        was beneath; it had touched the rock—dashed against it; it was
        wounded, torn in its fine locks, which are also its organs of
        respiration, absorption, and even of love.... The delicious creature,
        with its visible innocence and the iridescence of its soft colours,
        was left like a gliding, trembling jelly. I paused beside it,
        nevertheless; I glided my hand under it, raised the motionless body
        cautiously, and restored it to its natural position for swimming.
        Patting it in the neighbouring water, it sank to the bottom, giving
        no sign of life. I pursued my walk along the shore, but at the end of
        ten minutes I returned to my Medusa. It was undulating under the
        wind; it had really moved itself, and was swimming about with
        singular grace, its hair flying round it as it swam; gently it
        retired from the rock, not quickly, but still it went, and I soon saw
        it a long way off.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Medusæ are
        found in all seas, and usually inhabit the depths, although often
        seen on the surface. They voyage usually in considerable battalions,
        and sometimes cover miles and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>miles of sea. They constitute one of the
        principal supports of the whale. They are themselves singularly
        voracious, and snap up their prey—small molluscs, young crustaceans,
        and annilids—at a mouthful. Their mouths are in the centre of the
        lower side of the umbrella. They vary from a very small size to as
        much as a yard in diameter, while to describe the known varieties
        would occupy the remainder of this volume, so numerous are they. It
        has been ascertained that these jelly-like creatures breathe through
        the skin, have a distinct circulation and some nervous sensations.
        Most of them produce a stinging pain when they touch the human body,
        and until lately they were, adopting Cuvier’s classification,
        designated <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nearly all the
        other Hydrozoa are marine productions, and comprise among them
        numerous beautiful forms. Take, for example, the polyp known as
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Praya
        diphyes</span></span>, a double, bell-shaped body, with a long tail,
        as it were, of feelers, a floating fishing-line; or, another delicate
        organisation of the same family, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Galeolaria
        aurantiaca</span></span>, the orange galeolaria. Here are
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">two</span></span> floating bladders with a
        connecting <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">chain of polyps</span></span>; the floats aiding
        to support, as it were, a whole colony! But the large order
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Physophoridæ</span></span> deserves more than a
        mere passing notice, on account of the graceful forms of delicate
        tissue and colour which are included under it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These inhabitants
        of the sea are essentially swimmers, having mostly true swimming
        bladders, more or less numerous and of varied form; they always float
        on the surface. M. de Quatrefages, the distinguished French
        naturalist, describing one of these organisms, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apolemia
        contorta</span></span>, tells the reader <span class="tei tei-q">“to
        figure to himself an axis of flexible crystals, sometimes more than a
        mètre (forty inches) in length, all round which are attached, by
        means of long peduncles or footstalks equally transparent, some
        hundreds of bodies, sometimes elongated, sometimes flat, and formed
        like the bud of a flower. If we add to this garland of pearls of a
        vivid red colour and infinity of fine filaments, varying in
        thickness, and giving life and motion to all these parts, we have
        even now only a very slight and imperfect idea of this marvellous
        organism.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Agalma
        rubra</span></span> is thus described by Vogt, a great authority.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I know,”</span> says he, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“nothing more graceful than this agalma, as it floats
        near the surface of the waters, its long, transparent, garland-like
        lines extended, and their limits distinctly indicated by bundles of a
        brilliant vermilion red, while the rest of the body is concealed by
        its very transparency; the entire organism always swims in a slightly
        oblique position near the surface, but is capable of steering itself
        in any direction with great rapidity. I have had in my possession
        some of these garlands more than three feet in length, in which the
        series of swimming-bladders measured more than four inches, so that
        in the great vase in which I kept them the column of
        swimming-bladders touched the bottom, while the aërial vesicle
        floated on the surface. Immediately after its capture the columns
        contracted themselves to such a point that they were scarcely
        perceptible, but when left to repose in a spacious vase, all its
        shrunken appendages deployed themselves round the vase in the most
        graceful manner imaginable, the column of swimming-bladders removing,
        immovable in their vertical position, the float at the surface, while
        the different appendages soon began to play. The polyps, planted at
        intervals along the common trunk, of rose-colour, began to agitate
        themselves in all directions, taking a thousand odd forms; ...
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a name="Pg119"
        id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>but what most excited my
        curiosity was the continuous action of the fishing-lines, retiring
        altogether sometimes with the utmost precipitation. All who have
        witnessed these living colonies withdraw themselves reluctantly from
        the strange spectacle, where each polyp seems to play the part of the
        fisherman who throws his line, furnished with baited hooks,
        withdrawing it when he feels a nibble, and throwing again when he
        discovers his disappointment.”</span> The agalma is described as well
        armed; its tendrils have enormous stinging powers.</p><a name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One family of the
        Physophoridæ includes the interesting creature known as the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Portuguese man-of-war,”</span> from a slight
        resemblance to a small vessel with a sail up; it is also known among
        sailors as the sea-bladder. The bladder is eleven or twelve inches
        long, and from one to three broad. Its appearance is glassy and
        transparent, and of a purply tint. Above the bladder is a crest,
        limpid and pure as crystal, and veined in purple or violet; it is the
        crest which the sailors believe fulfils the office of a sail.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“This bladder-like form, with its aërial
        crest, is only a hydrostatic apparatus, whose office is to lighten
        the animal and modify its specific gravity.”</span> From the bottom
        of the bladder a crowded mass of organs, most of which take the form
        of very slender, highly contractile, movable threads, depend; they
        are often several feet, and occasionally several yards, long. Their
        stinging powers are great; these elegant creatures are terrible
        antagonists. One French writer says that, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“One day, when sailing at sea in a small boat, I
        perceived one of these little galleys, and was curious to see the
        form of the animal; but I had scarcely seized it when all its fibres
        seemed to clasp my hand, covering it as with bird-lime, and scarcely
        had I felt it in all its freshness (for it is very cold to the
        touch), when it seemed as if I had plunged my arm up to the shoulder
        in a cauldron of boiling water. This was accompanied with a pain so
        strange, that it was only with a violent effort I could restrain
        myself from crying aloud.”</span> Another traveller,<a id=
        "noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href="#note_32"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a> while
        bathing and swimming in the surf of the Antilles, was attacked by
        one. <span class="tei tei-q">“I promptly detached it,”</span> says
        he, <span class="tei tei-q">“but many of its filaments remained glued
        to my skin, and the pain I immediately experienced was so intense
        that I nearly fainted.”</span> In this case no very serious damage
        resulted, but during the voyage of the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Princess
        Louise</span></span> round the world a seaman was nearly killed by
        one. Frédol, the historian of the expedition, says that one of the
        officers noticed a magnificent Physalia, which was floating near the
        ship. <span class="tei tei-q">“A young sailor leaped naked into the
        sea to seize the animal. Swimming towards it, he seized it; the
        creature surrounded the person of its assailant with its numerous
        thread-like filaments, which were nearly a yard in length; the young
        man, overwhelmed by a feeling of burning pain, cried out for
        assistance. He had scarcely strength to reach the vessel and get
        aboard again before the pain and inflammation were so violent that
        brain fever declared itself, and great fears were entertained for his
        life.”</span> It is a disputed point whether the Physalia is
        poisonous or not when eaten. It was a commonly-received idea in the
        Antilles that they are, and that the negroes sometimes made use of
        them, after being dried and powdered, to poison both men and animals.
        The fishermen there believe that fish which have eaten parts of the
        Physalia become unfit for human food. A French physician, M.
        Ricord-Madiana, settled in Guadaloupe, made many experiments to
        attempt the settlement of the question. He found that ants and flies
        partook of them with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg
        120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>impunity; a dog, a puppy, and a fowl, swallowed
        parts of them nearly with impunity, the first named only seeming to
        have severely felt the sting in his mouth, but recovering perfectly
        soon after. The ardent experimentalist next ate, and caused his
        servant to eat, the chicken which had fed on Physalia, and no
        inconvenience followed; subsequently he ate twenty-five grains of the
        dried and powdered animal in a little bouillon, and he was unharmed.
        Yet there <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg
        121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>is
        some evidence on the other side which would indicate that on
        occasions, at least, it is poisonous.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The habits of the
        Physalia are only known in part, though they have been studied by
        many scientists. Among the many denizens of the ocean, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“none,”</span> says Gosse,<a id="noteref_33" name=
        "noteref_33" href="#note_33"><span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“take a stronger hold on the fancy of the
        beholder; certainly none is more familiar than the little thing he
        daily marks floating in the sun-lit waves, as the ship glides swiftly
        by, which the sailor tells him is the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Portuguese man-of-war.’</span> Perhaps a dead calm has
        settled over the sea, and he leans over the bulwarks of the ship,
        scrutinising this ocean-rover at leisure, as it hastily rises and
        falls on the long, sluggish heavings of the glassy surface. Then he
        sees that the comparison of the stranger to a ship is a felicitous
        one, for at a little distance it might well be mistaken for a child’s
        mimic boat, shining in all the gaudy painting in which it left the
        toy-shop.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Not unfrequently one of these tiny vessels comes so
        close alongside that by means of the ship’s bucket, with the
        assistance of a smart fellow who has jumped into the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘chains’</span> with a boat-hook, it is captured and
        brought on deck for examination. A dozen voices are, however, lifted,
        warning you by no means to touch it, for well the experienced sailor
        knows its terrible powers of defence. It does not now appear so like
        a ship as when it was at a distance. It is an oblong bladder of tough
        membrane, varying considerably in shape, for no two agree in this
        respect; varying also in size, from less than an inch to the size of
        a man’s hat. Once, on a voyage to Mobile, when rounding the Florida
        reef, I was nearly a whole day passing through a fleet of these
        little Portuguese men-of-war, which studded the smooth sea as far as
        the eye could reach, and must have extended for many miles.”</span>
        It is often to be seen on the coasts of Devon and Cornwall, brought
        thither by the Gulf Stream.</p><a name="illo_138" id="illo_138"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Physalia is
        the natural enemy of the cuttle-fish and the flying-fish. One an inch
        in length will numb and kill a fish larger than a herring.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Each tentacle, by a movement as rapid as a
        flash of light, or sudden as an electric shock, seizes and benumbs
        them, winding round their bodies as a serpent winds itself round its
        victim.”</span> Mr. Bennet, who accompanied the expedition under
        Admiral Fitzroy as naturalist, describes them as seizing their prey
        by means of the tentacles, which are alternately contracted to half
        an inch, and then shot out with amazing velocity to several feet,
        dragging the helpless and entangled prey to the sucker-like mouth and
        stomach-like cavities among the tentacles. Others have observed bold
        little fish unharmed among the feelers, a proof that even a Physalia
        can be good-natured sometimes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An attendant
        satellite of the Physalia is the Velella, a smaller animal of the
        same family, especially abundant in tropical seas, but often seen
        elsewhere. It also possesses stinging powers.</p><span class=

        must be counted the Madrepores, often regarded as corals, but quite
        distinct as a scientific group from the precious coral of commerce.
        The Madreporidæ are very numerous, and are formed by colonies of

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The polyps of the
        madrepores resemble flowers when their upper disc is expanded and
        their feelers are out in the water. When contracted, they are
        concealed from sight in the calcareous cells, which have grown with
        themselves, and form part of the madrepora. These beautiful and
        curious natural productions assume many distinct forms. Some of them
        are arborescent, as in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Stylaster flabelliformis</span></span>, which
        puts forth a perfect forest of trunks and branches. Others are
        star-like in shape; many are more or less cylindrical and oval, as in

        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Meandrina

        from a supposed resemblance to the mushroom, there being this
        difference between terrestrial and marine mushrooms—that the former
        have leaflets below, and the latter have them above. One of the most
        pleasing forms is found in the Plantain Madrepore, where the polyps
        are arranged in tufts.</p><a name="illo_141" id="illo_141" class=

        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Actinidæ</span></span>) will be now, thanks to
        the popularity of the aquarium, tolerably familiar to most readers.
        Although undoubtedly animal, they much more resemble flowers. They
        are to be found of the most brilliant colours and graceful forms.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The body of the
        Sea-anemone is <span class="tei tei-q">“cylindrical in form,
        terminating beneath in a muscular disc, which is generally large and
        distinct, enabling them to cling vigorously to foreign bodies. It
        terminates above in an upper disc, bearing many rows of tentacles,
        which differ from each other only in their size. These tentacles are
        sometimes decorated with brilliant colours, forming a species of
        collar, consisting of contractile and sometimes retractile tubes,
        pierced at their points with an orifice, whence issue jets of water,
        which are ejected at the will of the animal. Arranged in circles,
        they are distributed with perfect regularity round a central mouth.
        These are their arms.”</span> The stomach of the sea-anemone is both
        the seat of digestion and of reproduction. The young are actually
        ejected from the mouth with the rejecta of their food. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The daisy-like anemones in the Zoological Gardens of
        Paris,”</span> Frédol tells us, <span class="tei tei-q">“frequently
        throw up young ones, which are dispersed, and attach themselves to
        various parts of the aquarium, and finally become miniature anemones
        exactly like the parent. An actinia, which had taken a very copious
        repast, ejected a portion of it about twenty-four hours later, and in
        the middle of the ejected food were found thirty-eight young
        individuals.”</span> According to one author, an accouchement is here
        a fit of indigestion! Sea-anemones may be mutilated, cut limb from
        limb, or torn to pieces, and each piece will become a new anemone in
        the end. <span class="tei tei-q">“They adhere,”</span> says Dr.
        Johnson, <span class="tei tei-q">“to rocks, shells, and other
        extraneous bodies by means of a glutinous secretion from their
        enlarged base, but they can leave their hold and remove to another
        station whensoever it pleases them, either by gliding along with a
        slow and almost imperceptible movement (half an inch in five
        minutes), as is their usual method, or by reversing the body and
        using the tentacula for the purpose of feet, as Reaumur asserts, and
        as I have once witnessed; or, lastly, inflating the body with water,
        so as to render it more buoyant, they detach themselves, and are
        driven to a distance by the random motion of the waves. They feed on
        shrimps, small crabs, whelks, and on very many species of shelled
        mollusca, and probably on all animals brought within their reach
        whose strength or agility is insufficient to extricate them from the
        grasp of their numerous tentacula.... The size of the prey is
        frequently in unseemly disproportion to the preyer, being often equal
        in bulk to itself. I had once brought me a specimen of <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Actinia
        crassicornis</span></span> that might have been originally two inches
        in diameter, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg
        124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>which had somehow contrived to swallow a valve
        of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pecten
        maximus</span></span> of the size of an ordinary saucer. The shell,
        fixed within the stomach, was so placed as to divide it completely
        into two halves, so that the body, stretched tensely over, had become
        thin and flattened like a pancake. All communication between the
        inferior portion of the stomach and the mouth was, of course,
        prevented; yet, instead of emaciating and dying of atrophy, the
        animal had availed itself of what undoubtedly had been a very
        untoward accident to increase its enjoyment and its chance of double
        fare. A new mouth, furnished with two rows of numerous tentacula, was
        opened up on what had been the base, and led to the under stomach;
        the individual had, indeed, become a sort of Siamese Twin, but with
        greater intimacy and extent in its unions.”</span> The Actinia are at
        once gluttonous and voracious. They seize even mussels and crabs, and
        when they want to eject the hardest parts of the latter can turn
        their stomachs inside out, as one might turn out one’s pocket! Their
        tentacles can act on the offensive; the hand of the man who has
        touched them becomes inflamed, and small fish are literally killed by
        contact with them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Gorgons are
        interesting curiosities of the coral type; some are scarcely the
        twelfth of an inch in height, while others attain a height of several
        feet. The beautiful Fan Gorgon, which is often eighteen or more
        inches high, is so called on account of its form, and there are other
        very beautiful examples of arborescent gorgons. Their organism is
        double; the one external, sometimes gelatinous; sometimes, on the
        contrary, fleshy and cretaceous. It is animated with life.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A vast natural
        group is that of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Echinodermata</span></span>, which includes five
        orders, or <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg
        125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class=

        the sea-eggs, or sea-urchins, and the sea-cucumbers, or <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“sea-slugs”</span> (Holothurias), the latter of which are
        important items in the food of many Asiatics. The generic term
        Echinodermata signifies an animal bristling with spines, but the
        group includes many to whom it could not be applied.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Star-fish
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Asterias</span></span>) is met in almost every
        sea, and in all latitudes, although more richly varied in tropical
        seas. They vary in colour from a yellowish-grey to orange, red, or
        violet. The body of the asterias is a most curious organisation,
        having sometimes as many as 11,000 juxta-imposed pieces, while it
        possesses spines and tubercles. Observe one stranded on the shore,
        and it may appear destitute of locomotive powers. But this is not so,
        for they can slowly creep over small spaces, and even up the vertical
        sides of rocks. Frédol says:—<span class="tei tei-q">“If an asterias
        is turned upon its back, it will at first remain immovable, with its
        feet shut up. Soon, however, out come the feet like so many little
        feelers; it moves them backward and forward, as if feeling for the
        ground; it soon inclines them towards the bottom of the vase, and
        fixes them one after the other. When it has a sufficient number
        attached, the animal turns itself round. It is not impossible, whilst
        walking <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name=
        "Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>on the sea-shore, to
        have the pleasure of seeing one of these star-fishes walking upon the
        sand,”</span> although they are very commonly left dead there.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The star-fish’s
        mouth is on its lower side, and almost directly abuts on its stomach.
        It is a voracious feeder, and will even attack molluscs. Formerly it
        was believed that the animal would open an oyster with one of its
        rays, or legs, but this was unlikely, as the oyster might be likely
        enough to have the best of it in such a case by shutting his shells
        on the intruder. It is now pretty well understood that it injects an
        acrid poison into the oyster’s shell, which obliges it to
        open.</p><a name="illo_145a" id="illo_145a" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Urchins”</span> seem to owe their name to Aristotle, and
        their spiny covering and armature have in all ages attracted the
        attention of naturalists. Some of them have 3,000 or 4,000 prickles,
        and their organisation is really wonderful. They are enclosed in a
        globular hollow box, which grows with their growth. Gosse explains
        how. The box can never be cast off, and it is obvious that the
        deposits made from inside would only narrow the space, which really
        requires to be enlarged. <span class="tei tei-q">“The growing animal
        feels its tissues swelling day by day, by the assimilation of food.
        Its cry is <span class="tei tei-q">‘Give me space! a larger house, or
        I die!’</span> How is this problem solved? Ah! there is no
        difficulty. The inexhaustible wisdom of the Creator has a beautiful
        contrivance for the emergency. The box is not made in one piece, nor
        in ten, nor a hundred. Six hundred distinct pieces go to make up the
        hollow case, all accurately fitted together, so that the perfect
        symmetry of outline remains unbroken; and yet, thin as their
        substance is, they retain their relative positions with unchanging
        exactness, and the slight brittle box retains all requisite strength
        and firmness, for each of these pieces is enveloped by a layer of
        living flesh; a vascular tissue passes up between the joints, where
        one meets another, and spreads itself over the whole exterior
        surface.”</span> Their spines are instruments of defence and of
        locomotion; each has several muscles to work it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
        poet-scientist, Michelet, has beautifully painted the animal’s
        nature, and makes it describe itself as follows. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am born,”</span> says the unobtrusive Echinoderm,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“without ambition; I ask for none of the
        brilliant gifts possessed by those gentlemen the molluscs. I would
        neither make mother-of-pearl nor pearls; I have no wish for brilliant
        colours, a luxury which would point me out; still less do I desire
        the grace of your giddy medusas, the waving charm of whose flaming
        locks attracts observation and exposes one to shipwreck. Oh, mother!
        I wish for one thing only, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">to be</span></span>—to be without these exterior
        and compromising appendages; to be thickset, strong, and round, for
        that is the shape in which I should be the least exposed; in short,
        to be a centralised being. I have very little instinct for travel. To
        roll sometimes from the surface to the bottom of the sea is enough of
        travel for me. Glued firmly to my rock, I could there solve the
        problem, the solution of which your favourite, man, seeks for in
        vain—that of safety. To strictly exclude enemies and admit all
        friends, especially water, air, and light, would, I know, cost me
        some labour and constant effort. Covered with movable spines, enemies
        will avoid me. Now, bristling like a bear, they call me an
        urchin.”</span><a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The term
        <span class="tei tei-q">“sea-cucumber”</span> accurately describes
        the shape of the Holothuria, which is in general terms a worm-like
        cylinder, varying as much as from an inch or two to <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>thirty, and, in exceptional cases, forty
        inches in length. The skin of the animal is usually thick and
        leathery; it is crowned by a mouth with a fringe of tentacula, which
        expand like a flower when it is unmolested. They particularly avoid
        the glare of light. One large eatable species is common in the
        Mediterranean, and is used for food in Naples and elsewhere. But it
        is in the Indian, Malayan, and Chinese seas that the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Holothuria
        edulis</span></span>, known there as the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">trepang</span></span>,
        is an important adjunct to the food of the natives. Thousands of
        junks are employed in the trepang fisheries. The Malay fisherman will
        harpoon them with a long bamboo terminating in a sharp hook at a
        distance of thirty yards. In four or five fathoms of water native
        divers are employed, who seize them in their hands, and will bring up
        several at a time. They are then boiled, and flattened with stones;
        after which process they are spread out on bamboo mats to dry, first
        in the sun and afterwards by smoking. They are then put in sacks and
        shipped principally to Chinese ports, where they are considered a
        luxury.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great French
        navigator, Dumont d’Urville, witnessed the processes employed while
        in Raffles Bay. An hour after the arrival of four prows all the men
        were at work ashore cooking them in boilers placed over
        roughly-constructed stone furnaces, after which they were dried on
        hurdled roofs. Captain d’Urville went on board one of the Malay
        vessels, where he was received with cordiality by the padrone, or
        captain. <span class="tei tei-q">“He,”</span> says that navigator,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“showed us over his little ship. The keel
        appeared to us sufficiently solid; even the lines did not want
        elegance; but great disorder seemed to reign in the stowage
        department. From a kind of bridge, formed by hurdles of bamboos and
        junk, we saw the cabin, which looked like a poultry house: bags of
        rice, packets and boxes were huddled together. Below was the store of
        water, of cured trepang, and the sailors’ berths. Each boat was
        furnished with two rudders, one at each end, which lifted itself when
        the boat touched the bottom. The craft was furnished with two masts,
        without shrouds, which could be lowered on to the bridge at will by
        means of a hinge; they carry the ordinary sail; the anchors are of
        wood, for iron is rarely used by the Malays; their cables are made of
        rattan fibre; the crew of each bark consists of about thirty-seven,
        each shore boat having a crew of six men. At the moment of our visit
        they were all occupied in fishing operations, some of them being
        anchored very near to us. Seven or eight of their number, nearly
        naked, were diving for trepang; the padrone alone was unoccupied. An
        ardent sun darted its rays upon their heads without appearing to
        incommode them, an exposure which no European could hold up under. It
        was near mid-day, and the moment, as our Malay captain assured us,
        most favourable for the fishing. In fact, we saw that each diver
        returned to the surface with at least one animal, and sometimes two,
        in his hands. It appears that the higher the sun is above the
        horizon, the more easily is the creature distinguished at the bottom.
        The divers were so rapid in their movements that they scarcely
        touched the boat, into which they threw the animals before they dived
        again. When the boat was filled with them, it proceeded to the shore,
        and its place was supplied by an empty one.”</span> The Holothuria
        taken there were five to six inches long. D’Urville tasted it when
        prepared, and says that it resembled lobster. His men, however, took
        more kindly to it than did he.</p><a name="illo_145c" id="illo_145c"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We must now
        examine a most important class of pulpy animals, the Mollusca,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128"
        id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of which the bivalve molluscs
        are by far the most important to man. In consequence of their very
        softness and delicacy, Nature has provided them with a shell coat of
        calcareous mail.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sub-class
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Acephala</span></span>, are as their names
        indicate, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">headless</span></span> molluscs, and though
        sometimes <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">partially</span></span> naked, are usually very
        well protected by shells. When it is known that there are over 4,000
        species of bivalve molluscs, the impossibility of describing more
        than a few typical and prominent examples will be seen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The genus
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Teredo</span></span> consists of marine
        worm-like animals having a special and irresistible inclination for
        boring wood, whatever its hardness. Ships have been thus silently and
        secretly undermined, till the planks have been either like sponges or
        have crumbled into dust under the very feet of their crews. The holes
        bored by these imperceptible miners riddle the entire interior of a
        piece of wood, without any external indication of their ravages.
        Piles and piers have been utterly ruined, and vessels have sometimes
        gone to the bottom through them. At the beginning of the last century
        half the coast of Holland was threatened with inundation and
        practical annihilation because the piles which support its dykes were
        attacked by the teredo, and hundreds of thousands of pounds damage
        was done by this wretched worm. It has been now discovered that the
        worm has a great antipathy to oxide of iron, and wood impregnated
        with it is secure from its ravages. Other animals of the same group
        are capable of boring even rock.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another important
        bivalve is the well known Solen or <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“razor-fish,”</span> varieties of which are common all
        over the globe. <span class="tei tei-q">“These molluscs,”</span> says
        Figuier, <span class="tei tei-q">“live with their shells buried
        vertically in the sand, a short distance from the shore; the hole
        which they have hollowed, and which they never quit, sometimes
        attains as much as two yards in depth; by means of their foot, which
        is large, conical, swollen in the middle and pointed at its
        extremity, they raise themselves with great agility to the entrance
        of their burrow. They bury themselves rapidly, and disappear on the
        slightest approach of danger.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“When the sea retires, the presence of the Solen is
        indicated by a small orifice in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>sand, whence escape at intervals bubbles of air.
        In order to attract them to the surface, the fishermen throw into the
        hole a pinch of salt; the sand immediately becomes stirred, and the
        animal presents itself just above the point of its shell. It must be
        seized at once, for it disappears again very quickly, and no renewed
        efforts will bring it to the surface a second time. Its retreat is
        commonly cut short by a knife being passed below it; for it burrows
        into the ground with such velocity that it is difficult to capture it
        with the hand alone. The fish itself is a kind of marine
        worm.”</span></p><a name="illo_146a" id="illo_146a" class=

        the year 1236, when the master of a barque, an Irishman named Walton,
        was wrecked in the bay or creek of Aiguillon, a few miles distant
        from Rochelle. The exile at first supported himself by hunting
        sea-fowl in the neighbouring marshes, where he also soon began, being

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Walton remarked
        that many of the mussels attached themselves by preference to that
        part of posts or stones a little <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">above</span></span> the
        mud of the marshes, and that those so situated soon became plumper
        and fatter, and more suitable for edible purposes, than those buried
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">in</span></span> the mud. He soon saw the
        possibilities of a new branch of industry. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The practices he introduced,”</span> wrote a
        distinguished French writer, long ago, <span class="tei tei-q">“were
        so happily adapted to the requirements of the new industry, that,
        after six centuries, they are still the rules by which the rich
        patrimony he created for a numerous population is governed.”</span>
        He placed long rows of twelve-foot posts, about six feet high out of
        the watery mud, and a yard apart, each pair of which always formed a
        letter V; in other words, a number of them radiated from a common
        centre. The posts were interlaced with a basket-work of branches, so
        as to form continuous hurdles; these are now termed <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bouchots</span></span>.
        He also had isolated posts, and one of his great ideas was, as in
        oyster culture to-day, to arrest the spat, which <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>would otherwise have washed away to sea
        with the tide, and been lost. <span class="tei tei-q">“At the present
        time these lines of hurdles form a perfect little forest at
        Aiguillon; there are about a quarter of a million piles alone. In
        July the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">bouchotiers</span></span>, as the men employed
        in this culture are termed, launch their punts, and proceeding to the
        marshes, detach with a hook the thickly agglomerated masses of young
        mussels from the piles, which they gather in baskets and take to the
        bouchots, which form a perfect hedge of fascines and branches, of
        different heights. Each stage receives the mollusc suitable to it. In
        the first stage of its existence the mussel cannot endure exposure to
        the air, and remains constantly under water, except at the period of
        spring tides. These are gathered in sacks made of old matting, or
        suspended in interstices of the basket-work. The mussels are advanced
        stage after stage until they reach the highest bouchots, which remain
        out of water at all tides.”</span> The whole bay yielded close on
        half a million pounds sterling some years ago.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“While,”</span> says Figuier, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“commending the mussel as an important article of food,
        we must not conceal the fact that it has produced in certain persons
        very grave effects, showing that for them its flesh has the effects
        of poison. The symptoms, commonly observed two or three hours after
        the repast, are weakness or torpor, constriction of the throat and
        swelling of the head, accompanied by great thirst, nausea, frequent
        vomitings, and eruptions of the skin and severe itching.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The cause of these attacks is not very well ascertained;
        they have in turn been ascribed to the presence of the coppery
        pyrites in the neighbourhood of the mussel; to certain small crabs
        which lodge themselves as parasites in the shell of the mussel; to
        the spawn of star-fish or medusæ that the mussel may have swallowed.
        But, probably the true cause of this kind of poisoning is found in
        the predisposition of individuals. The remedy is very simple; an
        emetic, accompanied by drinking plentifully of slightly acidulated
        beverage.”</span> They are eaten very freely in most parts of the
        seaboard of the United States, and the present writer has eaten them
        constantly, boiled, stewed with tomatoes, &amp;c., and in soup,

        edulis</span></span>, the common oyster. This mollusc, which some
        might be inclined to place low in the scale of nature, has really a
        complex and delicate organisation. It has a mouth, heart, stomach,
        liver, and intestines; its blood is colourless, but it has a true
        circulation; and it breathes under water, as do fishes. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Having no head,”</span> says Figuier, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the oyster can have no brain; the nerves originate near
        the mouth, where a great ganglion is visible, whence issue a pair of
        nerves which distribute themselves in the regions of the stomach and
        liver, terminating in a second ganglion, situated behind the liver.
        The first nervous branch distributes its sensibility to the mouth and
        tentacles; the second, to the respiratory branchiæ. With organs of
        the senses oysters are unprovided. Condemned to a sedentary life,
        riveted to a rock, where they have been rooted, as it were, in their
        infancy, they neither see nor hear; touch appears to be their only
        sense, and that is placed in the labial tentacles of the
        mouth.”</span> The oyster may carry hundreds of thousands of
        eggs—some say as many as 2,000,000; it ejects them after a process of
        incubation. Nothing is more curious than to witness a bank of oysters
        in the spawning season, which is usually from the month of June to
        the end of Septem<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg

        adult—for the oyster is sexless—throws forth a living dust, a perfect
        cloud of embryotic life. The spat is soon scattered far and wide, and
        unless the young oyster attach itself to some solid body, it falls a
        victim to other marine animals. Microscopic in size when it leaves
        the parent, it is at the end of a month about the size of a large
        pea; in a year it may be an inch and a half in diameter; in three it
        is getting on to a quite respectable size, and after a short course
        in the oyster park it is ready for the table.<a id="noteref_36" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Oysters are of all
        sizes, and there are some so large that they require to be carved. In
        New York, the paradise of oyster-eaters, they range from the size of
        a half-crown to five or six inches long. The shores of Long Island, a
        distance round of 115 miles, are one continuous oyster-field, while
        the one State of Virginia is said to possess nearly 2,000,000 acres
        of oyster-beds. The Americans are great lovers of the bivalve, which
        is probably one of the most wholesome forms of <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">easy</span></span>
        nourishment which can possibly be taken. In a stew with milk, and a
        little oatmeal, or as soup, they are especially good for invalids,
        and when one can take nothing else, he can usually relish oysters.
        And, as all gastronomers know, they rather increase than diminish
        appetite; hence the modern French practice of taking half a dozen

        but oysters never.... We may eat them to-day, to-morrow, eat them
        always and in profusion, without fear of indigestion.”</span> The few
        who cannot eat them, and there <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">are</span></span> such, are really to be
        commiserated. How highly they are esteemed in some countries is shown
        by the fact that some years ago they cost in St. Petersburg a paper
        rouble, or about a shilling <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">each</span></span>; in Stockholm, fivepence
        each. In England only two or three years ago they had risen to nearly
        four-fifths of the latter price; but now, thanks to the extensive
        cultivation, and to the importation of excellent American oysters on
        a large scale, they are within the reach of all.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the quantity of
        oysters consumed in London alone who can give even an approximate
        guess? Fancy, if you can, also, that curiously courteous exchange
        which goes on every Christmas between our oyster-eating country
        cousins and our turkey and goose loving Londoners. The turkey, the
        brace of pheasants or hares, has arrived. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Such a present,”</span> says the author of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The Oyster,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“is promptly
        repaid by a fine cod packed in ice, and two barrels of oysters. How
        sweet are these when eaten at a country home, and opened by
        yourselves, the barrel being paraded on the table with its head
        knocked out, and with the whitest of napkins round it.
        *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* How sweet it is, too, to open some of the dear
        natives for your pretty cousin, and to see her open her sweet little
        mouth about as wide as Lesbia’s sparrow did for his lump of—not
        sugar, it was not then invented—but lump of honey! How sweet it is,
        after the young lady has swallowed her half-dozen, to help yourself!
        The oyster never tastes sweeter <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class=

        you do not <span class="tei tei-q">‘job’</span> the knife into your
        hand!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Greeks have
        not said much in praise of oysters, but then they regarded Britain
        much as we now do Greenland. The Romans, however, highly appreciated
        them. Horace, Martial, and Juvenal, Cicero, Seneca, and Pliny, have
        all enlarged upon the various qualities of the oyster; and it was to
        Sergius Orata that we owe the introduction of oyster-beds, for he it
        was that invented the layers or stews for oysters at Baia.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“That was in the days when luxury was
        rampant, and when men of great wealth, like Licinius Crassus, the
        leviathan slave-merchant, rose to the highest honours; for this
        dealer in human flesh in the boasted land of liberty served the
        office of consul along with Pompey the Great, and on one occasion
        required no less than 10,000 tables to accommodate all his guests.
        How many barrels of oysters were eaten at that celebrated dinner, the
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Ephemerides’</span>—as Plutarch calls
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The

        "font-style: italic">Morning Post</span></span> of that day—have
        omitted to state; but as oysters then took the place that turtle soup
        now does at our great City feeds, imagination may busy itself as it
        likes with the calculation. All we know is, that oysters then fetched
        very long prices at Rome, as the author of the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Tabella Ciberia’</span> has not failed to tell us; and
        then, as now, the high price of any luxury of the table was sure to
        make a liberal supply of it necessary when a man like Crassus
        entertained half the city as his guests, to rivet his
        popularity.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        later, the consumption of oysters in the <span class=

        in the <span class="tei tei-q">‘World’s Metropolis;’</span> and there
        is a statement, which I remember to have read somewhere, that during
        the reign of Domitian, the last of the twelve Cæsars, a greater
        number of millions of bushels were annually consumed at Rome than I
        should care to swear to. These oysters, however, were but
        Mediterranean produce—the small fry of Circe, and the smaller

        the Reculvers—the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        entertaining but veracious little work quoted before, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“on the shores of Cornwall which I cannot pass over,
        because from it came one of the colonies on the banks of the Thames
        from which the Whitstable boats still draw their annual supply. Into
        Mount’s Bay, the Helford River, upon which stands the little town of
        Helstone, empties itself, opposite Mount St. Michael’s, into the sea,
        and in the estuary of that little river, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>a person of the name of Tyacke, within the
        memory of the <span class="tei tei-q">‘oldest inhabitant,’</span>
        rented certain oyster-beds, famous among Cornish gourmets for a breed
        of oysters, which, it is said, the Phœnicians, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘a long time ago,’</span> had discovered to be infinitely
        preferable to the watery things they got at home. These Helford
        oysters are regularly brought to London.... Determined to make his
        venture, Tyacke loaded a fishing-smack with the best produce of his
        beds, and coasted along the southern shores, till passing round the
        Isle of Thanet he found himself in the mouth of the Thames. Little
        did the elated oyster-dredger think that mouth would swallow up the
        whole of his cargo; but so it came to pass. It had long been evident
        to those on board that oysters which travel, no less than men, must
        have rations allowed on the voyage, if they are to do credit to the
        land of their birth. Now the voyage had been long and tedious, and
        the oysters had not been fed; so Tyacke got into his boat, and
        obtained an interview with the owner of the spot when he reached the
        shore. He asked permission to lay down his oysters, and feed them.
        This was granted, and after a few days the spores of <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ulva
        latissima</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">enteromorpha</span></span>, and of the host of
        delicate fibrous plants which there abound, and all of which are the
        oyster’s delight, made the whole green and fat, and in the finest
        condition for re-shipment. Four days, it is said, will suffice to
        make a lean oyster, on such a diet, both green and plump; and Tyacke,
        joyful at the improvement which he daily witnessed, let his stock
        feed on for a week. It was towards evening that he bethought himself,
        as the tide was out, that if he meant to reach Billingsgate by the
        next morning it would be wise to re-ship his oysters before turning
        in for the night. The boat was lowered; but, as he attempted to land,
        he was warned off by the owner of the soil, who stood there with
        several fierce-looking fellows, armed with cutlasses and
        fowling-pieces, evidently anticipating the Cornishman’s intention,
        and determined to frustrate it at all hazards.</span></p>

        native waters, the oyster makes the voyage to the first station in
        his destined travels in company with his kind, and if it occupies a
        long time, is attentively supplied with refreshing sea-water. If
        taken proper care of, he arrives at the wharf as lively as when first
        taken from his native element. Witness the excellent American
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Blue Points,”</span> now commonly sold in
        England. Arrived in port, the oyster too often, however, first
        becomes sensible of the miseries of slavery, for here he is shovelled
        into carts and barrows, and tumbled into sacks, and he may consider
        himself greatly fortunate if he gets a drink of salted, not sea,
        water.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An old adage tells
        us that <span class="tei tei-q">“He was a bold man who first ate an
        oyster.”</span> Mr. Bertram tells us how the discovery was made.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Once upon a time a man of melancholy mood
        was walking by the shores of a picturesque estuary, and listening to
        the murmur of the <span class="tei tei-q">‘sad sea waves’</span>—or,
        as Mr. Disraeli would say, of <span class="tei tei-q">‘the melancholy
        main’</span>—when he espied a very old and ugly oyster-shell, all
        coated over with parasites and weeds. Its appearance was so
        unprepossessing that he kicked it aside with his foot; whereupon the
        mollusc, astonished at receiving such rude treatment on its own
        domain, gaped wide with indignation, preparatory to closing its
        bivalve still more closely. Seeing the beautiful cream-coloured
        layers that shone within the shelly covering, and fancying that the
        interior of the shell was probably curious or beautiful, he lifted up
        the aged <span class="tei tei-q">‘native’</span> for further
        examination, inserting his finger and thumb within the valves. The
        irate mollusc, thinking, no doubt, that this was intended as a
        further insult, snapped its nacreous portcullis close down upon his
        finger, causing him considerable pain. After relieving his wounded
        digit, our inquisitive gentleman very naturally put it in his mouth.
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Delightful!’</span> he exclaimed, opening
        wide his eyes; <span class="tei tei-q">‘what is this?’</span> and
        again he sucked his finger. Then flashed upon him the great truth
        that he had discovered a new pleasure—had, in fact, opened up to his
        fellows a source of immeasurable delight. He proceeded at once to
        realise the thought. With a stone he opened the oyster’s threshold,
        and warily ventured on a piece of the mollusc itself. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Delicious!’</span> he exclaimed; and there and then,
        with no other condiment than its own juice, without the usual
        accompaniment, as we now take it, of <span class="tei tei-q">‘foaming
        brown stout’</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">‘pale Chablis’</span>
        to wash it down—and, sooth to say, it requires neither—did that

        and then, after a score or twa in that way, some dizzen and a half
        wi’ vinegar, and finish off, like you, wi’ a wheen to the mustard,
        till the brodd is naething but shells.... There’s really no end in
        nature to the eatin’ of eisters.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Oyster-fishing is
        pursued in many different ways in different countries. Round Minorca,
        divers descend, hammer in hand, and bring up as many as they can
        carry. On the English <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg
        136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and
        French coasts a most destructive process is employed; a dredge-net,
        heavily weighted with an iron frame, is thrown overboard; it tears
        off a number of the precious bivalves from the bottom, and leaves a
        larger number buried in the mud. <span class="tei tei-q">“In
        France,”</span> says Figuier, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“oyster-dredging is conducted by fleets of thirty or
        forty boats, each carrying four or five men. At a fixed hour, and
        under the surveillance of a coastguard in a pinnace bearing the
        national flag, the flotilla commences the fishing. In the estuary of
        the Thames the practice is much the same, although no official
        surveillance is observed. Each bark is provided with four or five
        dredges, each resembling in shape a common clasp purse. These dredges
        are formed of network, with a strong iron frame, the iron frame
        serving the double purpose of acting as a scraper and keeping the
        mouth open, while giving a proper pressure as it travels over the
        oyster-beds.... The tension of the rope is the signal for hauling in,
        and very heterogeneous are the contents of the dredge—seaweeds,
        star-fishes, lobsters, crabs, actinia, and stones. In this manner the
        common oyster-beds on both sides of the Channel were ploughed up by
        the oyster-dredger pretty much as the ploughman on shore turns up a
        field.”</span> The consequence was that the fields became nearly
        exhausted. This led to the scientific cultivation now in vogue, which
        has proved most thoroughly successful in a commercial point of
        view.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Italy, the
        Neapolitan Lake Fusaro—the Acheron of so many of the classical
        poets—is a great oyster-park, dating from the days of the Romans. It
        is a salt, marshy pond, shaded by magnificent trees; its greatest
        depth is nowhere more than six feet; its bottom is black, the mud
        being of volcanic origin. The general idea involved in the oyster
        cultivation there is the protection of the embryo oyster. The
        fishermen of Lake Fusaro warehouse, as it were, in protected spots,
        the oysters ready to discharge the spawn or spat. Upon the bottom of
        the lake, and all around it, there are round pyramidal heaps of
        stones and artificial rockeries, surrounded by piles. Other piles
        have lines suspended from one to the other, each cord bearing a
        faggot or faggots of young branches and twigs. In the spawning season
        the young fry, issuing from the parents on the stones or rocks, are
        arrested by these means. They have, as it were, a resting-place
        provided for them on the piles and faggots.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The system pursued
        in France is that introduced by M. Coste, and founded on his study of
        the Fusaro park. In 1858 he reported to the Emperor that of
        twenty-three oyster-beds which had once existed at Rochelle,
        Marennes, Rochefort, the Isles of Ré and Oleron, only five were left,
        and that at other places formerly famed for oysters a similar
        mournful statement must be made. <span class="tei tei-q">“The impulse
        given by this report has been productive of the most satisfactory
        results in France. All along the coast the maritime populations are
        now actively engaged in oyster culture. Oyster-parks, in imitation of
        those at Fusaro, have sprung up. In his appeal to the Emperor, M.
        Coste suggested that the State, through the Administration of Marine,
        and by means of the vessels at its command, should take steps for
        sowing the whole French coast in such a manner as to re-establish the
        oyster-banks now in ruins, extend those which were prosperous, and
        create others anew wherever the nature of the bottom would permit.
        The first serious attempt to carry out the views of the distinguished
        Academician were made in the Bay of St. Brieuc. In the month of April
        in the same year in which his report was received operations
        commenced by planting 3,000,000 mother-oysters which had <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>been dredged in the common ground; brood
        from the oyster-grounds at Cancale and Tréquiers being distributed in
        ten longitudinal lines on tiles, fragments of pottery, and valves of
        shells. At the end of eight months the progress of the beds was
        tested, and the dredge in a few minutes brought up 2,000 oysters fit
        for the table, while two fascines, drawn up at random, contained
        nearly 20,000, from one to two inches in diameter.”</span> The
        publicity given to these facts excited great and practical interest,
        and in a short time the culture assumed gigantic proportions. The Bay
        of Arcachon was transformed into a vast field of production, no less
        than 1,200 capitalists, mostly very small ones, associated with an
        equal number of fishermen, having up to 1870 planted no less than 988
        acres of oysters. In this way the State organised two model farms for
        experimental purposes, at the trifling original cost of £114; it was
        estimated to be worth £8,000 in 1870, and had 5,000,000 oysters,
        large and small. 1,200 parks were then in active operations on the
        Isle of Ré, and 2,000 more in course of construction.</p><a name=

        which lies several miles inland, the whole of the estuary is occupied
        by oyster-farms, on which the maritime population, to the extent of
        3,000 people and upwards, is occupied, the sum paid for labour by the
        various companies being set down at £160,000 per annum, besides the
        employment given at Whitstable in building and repairing boats,
        dredges, and other requisites for the oyster-fishing. The business of
        the various companies is to feed oysters for the London and other
        markets, to protect the spawn or flotsam, as the dredgers call it,
        which is emitted on their own beds, and to furnish, by purchase or
        otherwise, the new brood necessary to supply the beds which have been
        taken up for consumption.”</span> The little Bay of Pont, on the

        though it may be cooked and treated like one, with satisfactory
        results. Its name is derived from the channeled edges and surfaces
        peculiar to it, which somewhat resemble the arrangements of the teeth
        of a comb. Centuries ago they were known as Pilgrims’ Shells; for in
        the middle ages the pilgrims were wont to ornament their habits or
        hats with these bivalves, of which there are not far from a couple of
        hundred known species. They are much more lively animals than the
        oyster, being able to shift about from place to place with some
        degree of agility; this they do by forcibly ejecting water between
        their shells, moving on by a kind of recoil. Another curious bivalve
        mollusc is the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Spondylus</span></span>, a genus found mostly in
        the warmer seas, some of the species of which are highly prized by
        conchologists. Their strong, brilliantly-coloured shells bristle with
        spines and feet. One of the most remarkable species is that known to
        naturalists as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Spondylus regius</span></span>, at all times
        scarce, and at one time extremely rare. In connection with the
        last-named mollusc, a story is told by M. Chenu, regarding an
        enthusiastic collector. <span class="tei tei-q">“M. R——,”</span> says
        Chenu, <span class="tei tei-q">“was Professor of Botany to the
        Faculty of Paris, and was, as sometimes happens, more learned than
        rich; he wished, on the invitation of a stranger, to purchase one of
        these shells at a very high price, which might be from 3,000 to 6,000
        francs (approximately £120 to £240); the bargain was made, and the
        price agreed upon; it was only necessary to pay. The money in the
        Professor’s hands made only a part of the sum the merchant was to
        receive for his shell, and he would not part with it without payment.
        M. R——, now consulting his desire to possess the shell more than his
        weak resources, made up secretly a parcel of his scanty plate, and
        went out to sell it. Without consulting his wife, he replaced his
        silver plate by articles of tin, and ran to the merchant to secure
        his coveted Spondylus, which he believed to be <span class=

        metamorphosis of her plate. She delivered herself of a thousand
        painful conjectures on the subject. M. R——, on his part, returned
        home happy with his shell, which he had committed to the safe custody
        of a box placed in his coat pocket. But as he approached the house he
        paused, and began for the first time to think of the reception he
        might meet with. The reproaches which awaited him, however, were
        compensated when he thought of the treasure he carried home. Finally,
        he reached home, and Madame R——’s wrath was worthy of the occasion;
        the poor man was overwhelmed with the grief he had caused his wife;
        his courage altogether forsook him. He forgot his shell, and in his
        trepidation, seated himself on a chair without the necessary
        adjustment of his garment. He was only reminded of his treasure by
        hearing the crushing sound of the breaking box which contained it.
        Fortunately the damage done was not very great—two spines only of the
        shell were broken; but the good man’s grief made so great an

        terminate in an elliptic cone. Otherwise they are varied enough, some
        being smooth, but others having ridges or scales on the outer
        surface, the edges being often dentated. Their colours are very
        varied. The head of the animal itself has two horns and two eyes; its
        foot is a thick fleshy disc, and when it means to hold on to a rock
        we all know how difficult it is to dislodge it, for the said foot
        becomes a kind of sucker. Some of those from the coast of Africa and
        the Antilles, &amp;c., have elegant forms, as witness <span class=

        very tough and indigestible. In Southern seas they attain to a great
        size; for example, in the Straits of Magellan the natives use for
        culinary purposes species as large as a slop-basin.</p><a name=

        one-shell molluscs the Purpuras bear an honoured name; for did they
        not furnish the Greeks and Romans with the brilliant purple colouring
        matter which was reserved for the mantles of princes and patricians!
        The genus <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Purpura</span></span> is characterised as
        possessing an oval shell, thick pointed. The animal itself has a
        large head, furnished with two swollen conical tentacles close
        together, and bearing an eye towards the middle of their external
        side. By means of a large foot they creep about in pursuit of
        bivalves. The larger and more important kinds come from the warmer
        seas, especially those surrounding the West Indies and Australia.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The purple
        mentioned in the Scriptures in connection with fine linen was that of
        the Phœnicians, and came from Tyre. Sir William Wilde discovered not
        far from the ruins of that city several circular excavations in a
        rocky cliff, and in these he found a great number of crushed and
        broken shells of Purpura. He believed that they had been bruised in
        great masses by the Tyrian workmen for the manufacture of the dye.
        Shells of the same species (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Murex trunculus</span></span>) are commonly
        found on the same coast at the present day. Aristotle says that the
        Tyrian dye was taken from two molluscs inhabiting the Phœnician
        coasts and seas. According to the great Greek philosopher, one of
        these had a very large shell, consisting of seven turns of the spire,
        studded with spines, and terminating in a strong beak; the other had
        a much smaller shell. It is thought that the latter is to be found in
        the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purpura
        lapillus</span></span>, which abounds in the English Channel. Reaumur
        and Duhamel both obtained a purple colour from it, which they applied
        as a dye, and found permanent. The real secret of the production of
        the Tyrian purple remains undiscovered to-day.</p><a name="illo_162a"

        abound in every sea, but are finer and more branching in the warmer

        "font-style: italic">Pteropoda</span></span>, practically
        <span class="tei tei-q">“winged feet”</span> molluscs, the position
        of which in scientific nomenclature many think unsatisfactory. This
        is, however, of little consequence to the general reader. These
        curious little molluscs can pass through the deep blue seas they
        usually inhabit rapidly, reminding us strongly of the movements of a
        butterfly or some other winged insect. They can <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“ascend to the surface very suddenly, turn themselves in
        a determinate space, or rather swim without appearing to change their
        place, while sustaining themselves at the same height.”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“If,”</span> continues Figuier, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“anything alarms them, they fold up their flappers and
        descend to such a depth in their watery world as will give them the
        security they seek. Thus they pass their lives in the open sea far
        from any other shelter except that yielded by the gulf weed and other
        algæ. In appearance and habits these small and sometimes microscopic
        creatures resemble the fry of some other forms of mollusca. They
        literally swarm both in tropical and arctic seas; and are sometimes
        so numerous as to colour the ocean for leagues. They are the
        principal food of whales and sea-birds in high latitudes, rarely
        approaching the coast. Only one or two species have been accidentally
        taken on our shores, and those evidently driven thither by currents
        into which they have been entangled, or by tempests which have
        stirred the waters with a power beyond theirs. Dr. Leach states that
        in 1811, during a tour to the Orkneys, he observed on the rocks of
        the Isle of Staffa several mutilated specimens of <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Clio
        borealis</span></span>. Some days after, having borrowed a large
        shrimp net, and rowing along the coast of Mull, when the sea, which
        had been extremely stormy, had become calm, he succeeded in catching
        one alive, which is now in the British Museum.”</span> Professor
        Huxley has told us that they have auditory organs, are sensible of
        light and heat, and probably of odours, but that they possess very
        imperfect eyes and tentacles. They have respiratory organs, hearts
        and livers, and are undeniably social and gregarious, swarming
        together in great numbers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We now approach
        the highest class of the mollusca—on paper, only, be it observed, for
        in actual life most of them are either nearly unapproachable, or, at
        all events, are most undesirable acquaintances.</p><span class=

        writer who in descriptive powers is an artistic scientist and a
        scientific artist, <span class="tei tei-q">“are indeed highly
        organised for molluscs, for they possess in a high degree the sense
        of sight, hearing, and touch. They appear with the earlier animals
        which present themselves on the earth, and they are numerous even
        now, although they are far from playing the important part that was
        assigned to them in the early ages of organic life upon our planet.
        The Ammonites and Belemnites existed by thousands among the beings
        which peopled the seas during the secondary epoch in the history of
        the globe.”</span> The Cephalopods were divided by Professor Owen
        into two great orders, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Tetrabranchiata</span></span>, or animals having
        four gills, and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Dibranchiata</span></span>, having two gills.
        The first order has at this epoch but one genus, that of <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nautilus</span></span>.
        This group of animals belongs emphatically to the earlier ages of our
        globe, <span class="tei tei-q">“is becoming gradually extinct, and
        presents in our days only some species very rare and few, especially
        when we compare them with the prodigious numbers of these beings
        which animated the seas of the ancient world.”</span> It is a fact
        that the empty shells of the nautilus are more commonly found
        floating on the ocean than those which are inhabited. No doubt the
        living nautilus falls a prey either to larger marine animals, or,
        likely enough, to sea-fowl. Is it not also possible that the lone
        animal, knowing the fate of its ancestors, and how they lie buried in
        barren strata, overwhelmed with melancholy apprehensions of his own
        future, jumps overboard and drowns himself? This suggestion is

        scion of a decayed family is a graceful object, and in fine weather
        projects his head and tentacles, and takes a general inspection of
        the ocean. On land, however, he does not shine to so much advantage,
        for there he has to drag himself over the ground, head down and body
        and shell up. The shell has a regularly convoluted form, and is
        divided into cells; doubtless this it was that gave the idea to the
        inventor of water-tight compartments. Through these passes a tube for
        respiration. In the outermost partition is the owner of the ship,
        covered by its mantle as a captain would be with pea-jacket or
        sou’-wester. The animal possesses numerous tentacles, and has two
        great eyes, enabling it to keep a good <span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Pearly
        Nautilus, common in the Indian seas, is sometimes used for food. Its
        shell occasionally attains to a height of eight inches, and is said
        to be even now used by Hindoo priests as the conch with which they
        summon their followers to prayers. A very fine nacre is yielded,
        which is used in ornamental work. The Orientals make drinking-cups of
        it, and adorn it with engraved devices. Many a retired old
        sea-captain has such about his house to-day; and before the world
        became so familiar with Asiatic productions they were often found in
        the houses of the wealthy.</p><a name="illo_166" id="illo_166" class=

        two murderers—a nipper and a sucker. The first is revealed to us by
        the imprint of the trilobite, an order now lost, the most destructive
        of extinct beings. The second subsists in one gigantic fragment, a
        beak nearly two feet in length, which was that of a great sucker, or
        cuttle-fish (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        a beak, this monster—if the other parts of the body were in
        proportion—must have been enormous; its ventose invincible arms, of
        perhaps twenty or thirty feet, like those of some monstrous spider.
        In making war on the molluscs he remains mollusc also; that is to
        say, always an embryo. He presents the strange—almost ridiculous, if
        it were not also terrible—appearance of an embryo going to war; of a
        fœtus furious and cruel, soft and transparent, but tenacious,
        breathing with a murderous breath—for it is not for food alone that
        it makes war: it has the wish to destroy. Satiated, and even
        bursting, it still destroys. Without defensive armour, under its
        threatening murmurs there is no peace; its safety is to attack. It
        regards all creatures as a possible enemy. It throws about its long
        arms, or rather thongs, armed with suckers, at random.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Victor Hugo’s
        description of the monster, the devil-fish (or octopus), with whom
        poor Gilliatt has that terrible encounter, will not fade from the
        mind of any one who has once read it. The poet-novelist tells us that
        he founded his narration on facts that came under his own notice.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Near Breck-Hou, in Sark,”</span> says he,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“they show a cave where a devil-fish, a few
        years since, seized and drowned a lobster-fisher.... He who writes
        these lines has seen with his own eyes, at Sark, in the cavern called
        the Boutiques, a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">pieuvre</span></span> (cuttle-fish) swimming,
        and pursuing a bather. When captured and killed, this specimen was
        found to be four English feet broad, and one could count its four
        hundred suckers. The monster thrust them out convulsively, in the
        agony of death.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hugo’s wonderful
        description of the monster, though often technically wrong,
        principally from exaggeration, must have some place here. He grasps
        the facts of nature with the appreciation of the artist rather than
        of the scientist.</p>

        kraken was made to embrace a three-masted vessel in its arms.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“If,”</span> says laughing De Montfort,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“my kraken takes with them, I shall make it
        extend its arms to both shores of the Straits of Gibraltar.”</span> A
        Bishop of Bergen assured the world that a whole regiment could easily
        manœuvre on the back of the kraken. All this, however, probably arose
        from the observation of some extraordinarily large specimen. An
        apparently well-authenticated fact is the following, vouched for by a
        French naval officer, and the then French Consul at the Canaries.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The steam corvette
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Alecton</span></span> fell in, between Teneriffe
        and Madeira, with a sea-monster of the cuttle kind, said to be fifty
        feet long, without counting its eight arms; it had two fleshy fins;
        they estimated its weight at close on two tons. The commander allowed
        shots to be fired at it, one of which evidently hit the animal in a
        vital part, for the waves were stained with blood. A strong musky
        odour was noticed. This is characteristic of many of the
        cephalopods.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The musket shots not having produced the desired
        results, harpoons were employed, but they took no hold on the soft,
        impalpable flesh of the marine monster. When it escaped from the
        harpoon, it dived under the ship, and came up again at the other
        side. They succeeded at last in getting the harpoon to bite, and in
        passing a bowline hitch round the posterior part of the animal. But
        when they attempted to hoist it out of the water the rope penetrated
        deeply into the flesh, and separated it into two parts, the head with
        the arms and tentacles dropping into the sea and making off, while
        the fins and posterior parts were brought on board: they weighed
        about forty pounds.”</span> The crew wished to pursue it in a boat,
        but the commander refused, fearing that they might be capsized.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“It is probable,”</span> says M.
        Moquin-Tandon,<a id="noteref_40" name="noteref_40" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most of the
        cephalopods secrete a blackish fluid, which they can eject in moments
        of danger, and thus cloud themselves in obscurity. This fluid was
        known to the Romans, who made ink from it. It is the leading
        ingredient in Indian ink and sepia to-day. A story is told of an
        English officer abroad who went out just before dinner-time for a
        walk on the beach, where he came across a cuttle-fish sheltering
        under a hollow rock. For a time each watched the other in mute
        astonishment, but the cuttle-fish had the best of it in the end. The
        aroused animal suddenly ejected a fountain of its black fluid over
        the officer’s trousers, which was the more annoying inasmuch as they
        were of white duck!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bone of the
        cuttle, powdered, has long been used, in combination with chalk,
        &amp;c., as a dentifrice, so that the <span class=

        nautilus is a pleasing example. <span class="tei tei-q">“Floating

        the exquisite living shallop! The elegant little bark which thus
        plays with the current is no work of human hands, but a child of
        nature: it is the argonaut, whose tribes, decked in a thousand
        brilliant shades of colour, are wanderers of the night in innumerable
        swarms on the ocean’s surface!”</span> The Greek and Roman poets saw
        in it an elegant model of the ship which the skill and audacity of
        the man constructed who first braved the fury of the waves. To meet
        it was considered a happy omen. <span class="tei tei-q">“O fish

        Pliny both gave careful descriptions of it. In India the shell
        fetches a great price, and women consider it a fine ornament.
        Dancing-girls carry them, and gracefully wave them over their
        heads.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The paper nautilus
        has more than its little sail to assist its progression; it is able
        to eject water against the waves, and so move onward. They are timid
        and cautious creatures, live in families, and are almost always found
        far out at sea: they never approach the shore.</p>

        we find the lowest form of articulate animals. They possess feet,
        breathe through gills, and derive their name from their hard crusty
        covering, which is mainly carbonate of lime with colouring matter.
        They have nearly all of them claws, which most of them know well how
        to employ offensively. <span class="tei tei-q">“They have been

        "tei tei-q">“Among all the curious and quaint forms of animal life to
        be found in the sea,”</span> says Lord, <span class="tei tei-q">“few
        for grotesque oddity can equal the baby crabs, or <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zoëa</span></span>, as
        they are sometimes called. These interesting infants are not the
        least like their papa or mamma, and no respectable or fully-matured
        male or female <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">crab</span></span> would ever own them as his or
        her offspring. An elfish little creature is the juvenile crab, with a
        head scarcely deserving the name, and a pair of goggle bull’s-eyes as
        of two policemen’s lanterns rolled into one, a tail vastly too long
        for him, and an anti-garotte spear, quite as long as his absurd
        little body, attached to the spot where his coat-collar should be....
        Master Crab’s internal economy is just as curious as his external
        skeleton. One pair of jaws one would be disposed to think sufficient
        for any living creature of reasonable requirements, but he possesses
        eight, and instead of exposing his teeth to the examination of the
        critical in matters of dentition, he carries them safely stowed away
        in the interior of his stomach, where they would be excessively hard
        to get at in cases of crustacean toothache. With such appliances as
        these the food cannot well be otherwise than perfectly masticated. A
        crab’s liver is an odd organ to contemplate, and constitutes a
        considerable portion of the soft interior of the shell-like box in
        which the heart and other viscera are lodged. That well-known
        delicacy known as the <span class="tei tei-q">‘cream’</span> or
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘fat’</span> of the crab is liver, and
        nothing else. The lungs, or gills, are formed by those fringe-like
        appendages popularly known as the <span class="tei tei-q">‘dead men’s
        fingers.’</span> The shell-shifting process before referred to is
        common to all crustaceans; and our friend the crab, when he feels his
        corselet getting rather tight for him, manages by some extraordinary
        process not only to extricate himself from it, together with his
        shell-gauntlets, and the powerful nippers with which he is provided,
        but performs other feats, compared with which those of the Davenport
        Brothers sink into utter insignificance.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nearly all the
        crustaceans are hardy and destructive, and fight not merely their
        enemies, but among each other. It matters little to them whether they
        lose a claw or a tail, for after a few weeks of repose those members
        grow again. Tandon records the fact that lobsters <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“which in an unfortunate encounter lost a limb, sick and
        debilitated, reappear at the end of a few months with a perfect limb,
        vigorous, and ready for service.”</span> On the Spanish coast a
        certain crab is caught for its claw alone, which is considered
        excellent eating; this is pulled off, and the mutilated animal thrown
        back into the sea, likely enough to be retaken, and the same process
        repeated at some future time. Crustaceans are nearly all carnivorous,
        and are by no means particular what they eat. Some of them, however,
        show considerable appreciation for the oyster. Sometimes they eat
        each other. Mr. Rymer Jones tells a story of one which attacked and
        commenced to eat one <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg

        Islands can not merely open a cocoa-nut, but also enjoy its contents.
        The crab begins by tearing off the fibre at the extremity where the
        fruit is, always choosing the right hand. When this is removed, it
        strikes it with its great claws until an opening is made; it then
        inserts its slender claws, and by wriggling and turning itself about
        removes the contents of the nut.</p><a name="illo_170" id="illo_170"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Hermit, or
        Soldier, Crab, with the exception of a kind of cuirass, or
        head-piece, has a soft, yielding skin. Knowing his own weakness, he
        invariably entrenches himself in some safe place, not unfrequently
        emptying the shell of some other marine animal. When he outgrows his
        borrowed habitation he looks out for some larger dwelling. He is a
        very timid creature, and retires at the least alarm. On the other
        hand, among his kind he is strong, voracious, and cruel. Two hermit
        crabs cannot meet without a fight brewing, but it rarely comes off.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Each extends his long pincers, and seems to
        try to touch the other, much as a spider does, when it seeks to seize
        a fly on its most vulnerable side; but each finding the other armed
        in proof and perfectly protected, though eager to fight, usually
        adopts the better part of valour, and prudently withdraws. They often
        have true passages of arms, nevertheless, in which claws are spread
        out and displayed in the most threatening manner, the two adversaries
        tumbling head over heels, and rolling one upon the other, but they
        get more frightened than hurt.”</span> Mr. Gosse, however, describes
        a struggle which had a tragic end. A hermit met a brother hermit
        pleasantly lodged in a shell much more spacious than his own. He
        seized it by the head with his powerful claws, tore it from its
        asylum with the speed of lightning, and took its place not less
        promptly, leaving the dispossessed unfortunate struggling on the sand
        in convulsions of agony. <span class="tei tei-q">“Our

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both crabs and
        lobsters are amazingly prolific, and lay an enormous number of eggs:
        it is computed that each female produces from 12,000 to 20,000 in a
        season; and yet these shell-fish are always dear in London! In
        France, Figuier tells us, the size of the marketable lobster is
        regulated by law, and fixed at a minimum of eight inches in length:
        all under that length are contraband. The London market is supplied
        from every part of our coasts, and very largely from Norway. At
        Kamble, near Southampton, one owner has storing-ponds, or tanks, for
        50,000 at a time; and he has his own smacks constantly running to the
        coasts of France, Scotland, and Ireland.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Lobster
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Homarus
        vulgaris</span></span>) is found in great abundance all round our
        coasts. Who that has frequented our seaside watering-places has not
        either gone out to assist in hauling up the lobster-pots, or, at all
        events, seen the fishermen returning with their spoils? And what
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">can</span></span> be finer than a lobster
        boiled, say not more than half an hour after his capture from the
        briny? He tastes very unlike the poor creature which has been
        conveyed by boat <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg
        155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>or
        train to London, and knocked about in barrows, carts, markets, and
        shops, until he wishes they would boil him, and have done with it at
        once. Lobster-pots are, practically, wicker-basket traps. The hole at
        the bottom allows free ingress, but makes it difficult for the victim
        to get out. They are baited with garbage, and the position of each on
        the rocks or sand below is marked by a buoy. Each fisherman has his
        own private mark on them; and woe to the lobster-thief, as to the
        crab-thief! Sometimes nets are used for catching lobsters.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Pennant says
        that large lobsters are in their best season from the middle of
        October to the beginning of May. The smaller ones are good all the
        summer. If they are four-and-a-half inches long from the top of the
        head to the end of the back shell they are called <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“sizable”</span> lobsters; if under four inches,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“half-size,”</span> and two are reckoned as
        one of size. Under four inches, they are called <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“pawks.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is little
        doubt that up to a certain age lobsters shed their shells annually,
        but the mode of performance is not quite understood to-day.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“It is supposed that the old shell is cast,
        and that the animal retires to some lurking-place till the new
        covering acquires consistence to contend with his armour-clad
        congeners.... The most probable conjecture is that the shell sloughs
        off piecemeal, as it does in the cray-fish. The greatest mystery of
        all, perhaps, is the process by which the lobster withdraws the
        fleshy part of its claws from their calcareous covering. Fishermen
        say the lobster pines before casting its shell, and thus gets thin,
        so as to permit of its withdrawing its members from it.”</span> He
        sheds tears first, and shell second.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The common English
        lobster, as seen in the fishmonger’s shop, is very unlike his
        relatives beneath the waves. <span class="tei tei-q">“The curled-up
        form,”</span> says Major Lord, <span class="tei tei-q">“in which he
        is seen when so exposed is not that usually assumed in his own
        element, except in the act of exerting its immense powers of
        retrograde motion. These are so great that one sudden downward sweep
        of its curiously-constructed oar-like tail is sufficient to send it
        like an arrow, three or four and twenty feet, with the most
        extraordinary precision, thereby enabling our friend to retreat with
        the greatest rapidity into nooks, corners, and crevices among the
        rocks, where pursuit would be hopeless. His eyes being arranged on
        foot-stalks, or stems, are free from the inconvenient trammels of
        sockets, and possess a radius of vision commanding both front and
        rear, and from their compound form (being made up of a number of
        square lenses) are extremely penetrating and powerful. The slightest
        shadow passing over the pool in which the lobster may chance to be
        crawling or swimming will frequently cause one of these backward
        shoots to be made, and the lobster vanishes into some cleft or cavity
        with a rapidity of motion which no harlequin could ever, in his
        wildest dreams, hope to achieve. Down among the deep channels,
        between the crags at the sea’s bottom, alarms, except from the
        sea-robbers themselves, are not to be dreaded. Here the lobsters are
        at home, and in such spots the wicker trap, or the trunk net, may be
        laid down for them: nets of this kind are in general use. They are
        made by fastening a number of stout wooden hoops to longitudinal
        bars, and covering them with network. Their internal construction is
        much like that of the crab-pot, only there are two entrances instead
        of one, and twine is used instead of willows or twigs to prevent the
        prisoners from escaping. Heavy stones are attached to them as
        sinkers. Fish offal is used as bait, and corks at the end of lines
        serve to point out their position and haul them up by. <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Lobsters are prolific creatures, and it is
        well that they are so, considering the enormous quantities consumed
        every day in England alone.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It has been computed that each fully-matured female will
        produce from 18,000 to 20,000 eggs, and there is little doubt but
        that with proper management and the expenditure of a very small
        capital artificial fecundation of the ova might be most successfully
        and profitably conducted in this country. Much attention has of late
        been paid to this subject in France, and many most interesting
        experiments in connection with it have been tried. The number of
        lobsters brought every season to Billingsgate Market will serve to
        give some idea of the importance of lobster fishing, and the sums of
        money which must change hands in connection with it. Calculations
        show that from the coasts of England, Ireland, Scotland, and the
        Channel Islands 150,000 lobsters per season reach Billingsgate,
        exclusive of the supply of Norway lobsters, which are even more
        abundantly supplied, over 600,000 per season being imported. It not
        unfrequently happens that one day’s supply for that great emporium of
        sea dainties reaches as high as 25,000, and here at early morning,
        long before mighty London is fairly up for the day, a scene of bustle
        and activity may be witnessed which well repays the early riser.
        Steam in clouds floats above the vast loads of newly-boiled
        crustaceans and molluscs; and carts of every size and pattern block
        the way.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The regular
        lobster season lasts from the month of March to August. About the
        middle or latter end of the last-mentioned month the shifting of
        shells takes place, and the fish is unfit for human food; but, like
        the silkworms after a change of skin, they commence feeding in the
        most voracious manner directly the new garment is durable enough to
        admit of their taking their walks abroad, and their temporary
        seclusion and compulsory abstinence are amply made up by a course of
        heavy feeding. The lost plumpness and condition soon return. Unlike
        some crustaceans who are coldly indifferent to the welfare of their
        offspring, the mamma lobster keeps her little brood about her until
        the youthful lobsterkins are big enough to start in life for
        themselves.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The coasts of
        British North America, as well as many portions of the seaboard of
        the United States, abound in mail-clad inhabitants of many kinds. In
        some localities great amusement is at times afforded by their
        capture—a sort of picnic, or lobster frolic, being organised. A boat,
        with plenty of eatables and drinkables, and a capacious pot, are
        provided, and long poles with their ends split prepared. On the boat
        being propelled slowly through the shallow water, a sharp look-out is
        kept on the regions below, and on the lobster being discovered, the
        split end of the pole is lowered quietly, and with the greatest
        caution, until just over the unsuspecting victim’s back, when by a
        sudden downward thrust the forceps-like instrument securely nips him,
        and he is brought to the surface in spite of his claws and the
        pinches he inflicts on the tough, unyielding wood. Some overhanging
        rock or pleasant nook on the shore is usually selected as a place in
        which to dine and cook the proceeds of the lobster
        hunt.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bays,
        shallows, and mouths of rivers on the coast of Prince Edward’s Island
        abound in a species of seaweed known amongst the inhabitants as
        <span class="tei tei-q">“eel-grass,”</span> on which vast numbers of
        lobsters feed as in a rich sea-garden. To these favoured hunting
        grounds the lobster-catchers betake themselves, and by wading little
        more than half-leg deep gather as many as they require. A bushel
        basket has been filled in this way in less than an hour.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Like the branching
        growths of submarine life which form the connecting link between the
        vegetable and animal kingdoms, we find crustaceans dwelling, so to
        speak, on the border-lands of other races, and linking the shrimp,
        crab, and lobster families together; partaking of the nature of each,
        but being identical with neither; such are the so-called <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Squat
        Lobsters</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Galathea</span></span>. Their singular alertness
        renders capture somewhat difficult. Like the lobster, they possess
        extraordinary powers of vision and retrograde movement. The horns are
        extremely long, and so sensitive that the slightest touch seems to
        reveal at once the nature of an approaching object, and enables the
        alarmed squat to seek a safe sanctuary between the rock clefts, from
        which it is by no means easy to withdraw him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class=

        thorn-coated shell, long horns, powerful nippers, and generally
        formidable appearance, be familiar to most of our readers. Like most
        other crustaceans, the cray delights in a home among rugged sunken
        rocks, and is taken in the traps laid for ordinary lobsters and
        crabs. Their flesh, being of harder texture and sweeter flavour, is
        objected to by professed lobster-eaters; still, a well-conditioned
        spined lobster is by no means to be despised. Some portions of the
        Pacific Ocean, and the warm seas of the East, contain them in vast
        numbers. Many spots on the coast of South America, and the bays and
        inlets of the island of Juan Fernandez, literally swarm with them.
        Some idea may be formed of the abundance of animated creatures of
        this and other kinds to be taken in these seas by the following
        account of the fishing to be obtained in them, given by the Hon. F.
        Walpole:—<span class="tei tei-q">“The fishing afforded the best
        return for labour, and a boat might be filled in four hours with hook
        and line only. Fish swarmed of every size and colour, and seemingly
        of every variety of appetite, for they took any bait. The bottom was
        literally lined with crawfish of a large size; some must have weighed
        five pounds at least. There needed no hook—a piece of anything let
        down on a string to the bottom was enough; they saw it, grasped it,
        and kept their hold till you had seized them by their long feelers
        and borne them into the boat, where they crawled about and extended
        their feelers as if in search of more bait.... We had crawfish for
        breakfast, crawfish for dinner, crawfish for supper, and crawfish for
        any incidental meal we could cram in between.”</span> The coral reefs
        fringing the island of Mauritius afford shelter to numbers of the
        family of crawfish, which in both size and splendour of colouring far
        excel those taken in our seas.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The prawn and
        shrimp are included in the same order as the lobster and the crab,
        and species of these crustaceans are found in all seas. They are the
        scavengers of the ocean, and pick and devour any dead matter in the
        sea; hence they are particularly valuable in the aquarium. The art of
        shrimping will no doubt be familiar to all our readers, from visits
        made to our south-coast watering-places. In tropical climates the
        prawn attains the size of a small lobster—up to nine or ten inches in
        length, three being considered sufficient for a meal. Prawns are sold
        in Dublin six and seven inches in length, and are considered splendid
        feeding.</p>

        work treating of their natural home, the ocean.<a id="noteref_43"
        name="noteref_43" href="#note_43"><span class=

        intended always to live in water, have wonderful organs to aid them
        in swimming. <span class="tei tei-q">“The anterior limbs,”</span>
        says Figuier, <span class="tei tei-q">“which correspond with the arms
        in man and the wings in birds, are attached to each side of the
        trunk, immediately behind the head, and form the pectoral fins. The
        posterior limbs occupy the lower surface of the body, and form the
        ventral fins. The latter, which are always over the ventral line, may
        be placed before, beneath, or, as is most usual, behind the former.
        Fishes possess, besides these two pair of fins, odd fins. The fins
        which are found on the back or dorsum are called the back or dorsal
        fins, those at the end of the tail are the caudal fins; finally,
        there is frequently another attached to the lower extremity of the
        body, which is called the anal fin. These fins are always nearly of
        the same structure, consisting generally of a fold of the skin,
        supported by slender, flexible, cartilaginous, or osseous rays,
        connected by a thin membrane.”</span> The muscles which move these
        fins are powerful. Further, nearly all species of fish possess a
        swimming bladder, over which the animal has control, and can thereby
        increase or diminish the specific gravity of its body. Immediately
        behind the head are the gill openings; respiration is effected by
        water, in its natural state always charged with air, being taken in
        at the mouth, which passes over the gills, and is afterwards ejected.
        The eyes in fish are usually very large.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The scientific
        classification of fishes usually adopted is that of Muller. He
        divided them into five groups, the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Leptocardia</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Cyclostomata</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Selachia</span></span>,
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Ganoidea</span></span>, and <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Teleostea</span></span>. The first of these is
        represented by a single genus, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Amphioxus</span></span>, a little slender
        gelatinous fish, rarely over two inches in length, and commonly found
        on all sandy coasts. The second order is characterised as serpentine,
        void of fins, and with a mouth formed for suction. The lamprey is a
        familiar example.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The third order,
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Selachia</span></span>, includes a number of
        cartilaginous fish, varying much in form; the rays, dog-fish, skate,
        torpedo, shark, and saw-fish belong to this important division. The
        torpedo has the power of giving a strong electrical shock. Redi, an
        Italian naturalist of the seventeenth century, first studied them
        carefully. He caught and landed an electric ray, and pressing it with
        his hand, experienced a tingling sensation, which extended to his
        arms and shoulders, and was followed by a disagreeable trembling.
        This electric power dies with the animal. Dr. Walsh made some
        interesting experiments with them. He placed <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>a living torpedo on a clean wet towel, and
        connected brass wires with it. Round the torpedo were eight persons,
        standing on isolating substances. One end of the wire was placed in a
        basin full of water. The first person had a finger of one hand in
        this basin, and a finger of the other in a second basin, also full of
        water. The second person had a finger in the last-named basin, and a
        finger of the other hand in a third basin, and so on round the circle
        of eight persons. The end of the second wire was plunged into the
        last basin of the series, thus establishing a complete electric
        circuit. At the moment when the experimenter touched the torpedo a
        tolerably strong shock was felt by all participating. When the
        torpedo was placed on an isolated supporter, it showed its energy by
        communicating to several persons forty or fifty shocks in the short
        space of a minute and a half.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The family
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Carcharidæ</span></span> includes the true
        sharks, some species of which attain to a length of twenty, or even
        thirty, feet. They are the terror of all other fish and molluscs.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“But the prey which has the greatest charm
        for him is man; the shark loves him dearly, but it is with the
        affection of the gourmand. If we may believe some travellers, when
        several varieties of human food comes in its way, the shark prefers
        the European to the Asiatic, and both to the negro.”</span> He has
        been known to jump clean aboard a fisherman’s boat, and even to snap
        up a sailor from the shrouds. Commerson relates the following:—The
        corpse of a negro had been suspended from a yard-arm <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">twenty
        feet</span></span> above the level of the sea. A shark was seen
        making every effort to reach the body, which eventually he did, and
        tore it limb from limb in presence of the horror-stricken crew. The
        mouth of the shark is placed in the lower part of the head, and the
        animal has to turn itself in the water before he can seize an object
        above him. On the African coast the negroes take advantage of this
        fact; they swim towards him, and seize the moment when he turns to
        rip up his belly with a large strong knife. The adult shark has six
        rows of murderous-looking teeth, forming a perfect arsenal of deadly
        weapons.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Captain Basil Hall
        describes the mode by which sharks are sometimes captured.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The sharp-curved dorsal fin of a huge shark
        was seen rising about six inches above the water, and cutting the
        glazed surface of the sea by as fine a line as if a sickle had been
        drawn along it. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Messenger, run to the cook
        for a piece of pork,’</span> cried the captain, taking the command
        with as much glee as if an enemy’s cruiser had been in sight.
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Where’s your hook, quartermaster?’</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Here, sir, here,’</span> cried the fellow,
        feeling the point, and declaring it was as sharp as any lady’s
        needle, and in the next instant piercing with it a huge junk of pork
        weighing four or five pounds. The hook, which is as large as one’s
        little finger, has a curvature about as large as a man’s hand when
        half closed, and is six or eight inches in length, while a formidable
        line, furnished with three or four feet of chain attached to the end
        of the mizen topsail halyard, is now cast into the ship’s
        wake.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Sometimes the very instant the bait is cast over the
        stern the shark flies at it with such eagerness that he actually
        springs partially out of the water. This, however, is rare. On these
        occasions he gorges the bait, the hook, and a foot or two of the
        chain, without any mastication, and darts off with the treacherous
        prize with such prodigious velocity that it makes the rope crack
        again as soon as the coil is drawn out. Much dexterity is required in
        the hand which holds the line at this moment. A bungler is apt
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161"
        id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to be too precipitate, and jerk
        away the hook before it has got far enough into the shark’s stomach.
        The secret of the sport is to let the monster gulp down the whole
        bait, and then to give the line a violent pull, by which the barbed
        point buries itself in the coat of the stomach. When the hook is
        first fixed it spins out like the log-line of a ship going twelve
        knots.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The suddenness of the jerk with which the shark is
        brought up often turns him quite over. No sailor, however, thinks of
        hauling one on board merely by the rope fastened to the hook. To
        prevent the line breaking, the hook snapping, or the jaw being torn
        away, a running bowline is adopted. This noose is slipped down the
        rope and passed over the monster’s head, and is made to join at the
        point of junction of the tail with the body; and now the first part
        of the fun is held to be completed. The vanquished enemy is easily
        drawn up over the taffrail, and flung on deck, to the delight of the
        crew.”</span> Even then he is sometimes a very formidable enemy. The
        flesh of the shark, though sometimes eaten, is coarse and
        leathery.</p><a name="illo_180" id="illo_180" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On several of the
        smaller islands of the Spanish Main whaling stations are established.
        After the huge fish have been captured, they are towed by the boats
        to one of these stations, and the blubber is stripped off and carried
        on shore to the boiling-house in large white blocks, where a simple
        apparatus is set up for <span class="tei tei-q">“trying-out”</span>
        the oil. It sometimes happens that immediately after the whale has
        been killed the sharks surround it in such numbers, and devour the
        blubber with such rapacity, that if the distance be great and the
        currents adverse, the greater part has been eaten off before the
        whale can be towed ashore; and the labour of the fishermen is thus
        thrown away.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tiger-shark is
        a more formidable monster than others of its tribe, because of its
        power of seizing its prey without turning on its back or side. It is
        enabled to do this from the great size of its mouth, and from its
        position, which is near the end of the snout, instead of underneath,
        as in other varieties of the shark.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“As soon as the carcase of the whale has been stripped of
        its blubber, it is towed out at high water to a sufficient distance
        from the station to ensure of its being carried away by the falling
        tide. This is necessary, for the stench from so large a mass of
        putrefying flesh, exposed as it has been to the intense action of a
        tropical sun for three or four days, is more than
        unpleasant.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Now is the opportunity for the shark-hunters. They take
        possession of the remains, tow them to some convenient nook of the
        Bocas, as the channels between the islands are called, and there
        anchor them. All is now prepared, and nothing remains but eagerly and
        silently to watch for the assembly of the ravenous brutes to their
        midnight orgies.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The liver of the
        shark yields a most valuable oil, largely used in the colony as a
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162"
        id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>substitute for cod-liver oil.
        The liver of a shark fifteen feet long will yield from twelve to
        sixteen gallons of oil.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The canoes used
        for shark-hunting are some twenty feet in length. In the bow a deep
        groove is cut, to guide the rope after the fish has been struck. A
        coil of fifteen fathoms of rope, carefully arranged under the
        thwarts, is secured at one end to a piece of strong chain, at the
        other end of which is a harpoon. A lance is kept on board to assist
        in giving the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">coup de grâce</span></span> to the shark when he
        has exhausted himself sufficiently.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The inhabitants of
        many parts of the African coasts worship the shark, and consider its
        stomach the road to heaven. Three or four times a year they row out
        and offer the shark poultry and goats to satisfy his appetite. This
        is not all; a child is once a year sacrificed to the monster, which
        has been specially fattened for this occasion from its birth to the
        age of ten. On the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">fête</span></span> day, the unfortunate little
        victim is bound to a post on a sandy point at low water; as the tide
        rises the sharks arrive. The child may shriek, and the mother may
        weep, but it is of no avail; even its own parent thinks that the
        horrible sacrifice will ensure her child’s entry into
        heaven.</p><a name="illo_183a" id="illo_183a" class=

        hammerhead, and the saw-fish, belong to the same great order. The
        last named will attack any inhabitant of the deep whatever, and even
        dares to measure his strength with the whale. Its length is from
        twelve to fifteen feet, while its weapon of defence is sometimes as
        much as two yards in length. Occasionally it dashes itself against

        prominent example. It is essentially a sea-fish, although ascending
        rivers at stated periods, as does the salmon. It is particularly
        noticeable for the number of bony plates or scales on its back and
        belly. In the sea the sturgeon feeds on herrings, mackerel, and other
        fish; in the rivers on salmon. It is caught in traps, or in nets. The
        prepared roe, cleaned, washed in vinegar, and partially dried, is the
        caviare of the Russians. The eggs of a female sturgeon will weigh
        over one-third of its entire body, and as they sometimes reach a
        weight of nearly 3,000 pounds, the preparation of caviare becomes an
        important and profitable industry.</p><a name="illo_183b" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The flying-fish
        have been incidentally mentioned before in this work. Captain Basil
        Hall observed a flight of 200 yards; they have come on board a vessel
        fourteen or fifteen feet, and into the chains of a line-of-battle
        ship twenty feet above the water. They are considerably harassed by
        the attacks of other fish, and when they take to the air often fall
        victims to gulls and other sea-birds. Sharks and dolphins are their
        particular enemies. Their glittering, silvery brilliancy is most
        beautiful in the brightness of tropical seas.</p><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the most
        important bony fishes must certainly be first placed the salmon,
        which includes three well-known species, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Salmo
        salar</span></span> (the salmon itself), <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">S. fario</span></span>
        (the salmon trout), and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">S. trutta</span></span> (the trout). The early
        life of the salmon is interesting. The infant fry is primarily, of
        course, very helpless, and during the first two or three weeks of its
        existence carries about with it, as a provision for food, a portion
        of the yolk of the egg from which it was hatched. This generally
        lasts it from twenty to forty days. It is two years before the
        youngster ventures out to sea. In the first stage the young salmon is
        called a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">parr</span></span>; during the second it is a
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">smolt</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, a
        parr plus a covering of silvery scales. The smolt, which in the
        course of its two or more years’ stay in the river has only attained
        a growth of six or eight inches, returns from the sea in a couple of
        months weighing three or four pounds, and after six months ten or
        twelve pounds. It is now a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">grilse</span></span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dr. Bertram says
        of the salmon’s growth:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The sea-feeding must be favourable, and the condition of
        the fish well suited to the salt-water to ensure such rapid growth—a
        rapidity which every visit of the fish to the ocean serves but to
        confirm. Various fish, whilst in the grilse state, have been marked
        to prove this; and at every migration they returned to their
        breeding-stream with added weight and improved health. What the
        salmon feeds upon whilst in the salt-water is not well known, as the
        digestion of the fish is so rapid as to prevent the discovery of food
        in their stomachs when they are captured and opened. Guesses have
        been made, and it is likely that these approximate to the truth; but
        the old story of the rapid voyage of the salmon to the North Pole and
        back again turns out, like the theory upon which was built up the
        herring migration romance, to be a mere myth.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“None of our naturalists have yet attempted to elucidate
        that mystery of salmon life which converts one-half of the fish into
        sea-going smolts, whilst as yet the other moiety remain as parr. It
        has been investigated so far at the breeding-ponds at Stormontfield,
        but without resolving the question. There is another point of doubt
        as to salmon life which I shall also have a word to say about—namely,
        whether or not that fish makes two visits annually to the sea;
        likewise, whether it be probable that a smolt remains in the salt
        water for nearly a year before it becomes a grilse. A salmon only
        stays, as it is popularly supposed, a very short time in the salt
        water; and as it is one of the quickest-swimming fishes we have, it
        is able to reach a distant river in a very short space of time,
        therefore it is most desirable we should know what it does with
        itself when it is not migrating from one water to the other; because,
        according to the opinion of some naturalists, it would speedily
        become so deteriorated in the river as to be unequal to the slightest
        exertion....</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“At every stage of its career the salmon is surrounded by
        enemies. At the very moment of spawning, the female is watched by a
        horde of devourers, who instinctively flock to the breeding-grounds
        in order to feast on the ova. The hungry pike, the lethargic perch,
        the greedy trout, the very salmon itself, are lying in wait, all
        agape for the palatable roe, and greedily swallowing whatever
        quantity the current carries down. Then the waterfowl eagerly pounces
        on the precious deposit the moment it has been forsaken by the fish;
        and if it escape being gobbled up by such cormorants, the spawn
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164"
        id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>may be washed away by a flood,
        or the position of the bed may be altered, and the ova be destroyed,
        perhaps for want of water. As an instance of the loss incidental to
        salmon-spawning in the natural way, I may just mention that a whiting
        of about three-quarters of a pound weight has been taken in the Tay
        with three hundred impregnated salmon ova in its stomach! If this
        fish had been allowed to dine and breakfast at this rate during the
        whole of the spawning season it would have been difficult to estimate
        the loss our fisheries would have sustained by his voracity. No
        sooner do the eggs ripen, and the young fish come to life, than they
        are exposed, in their defenceless state, to be preyed upon by all the
        enemies already enumerated; while, as parr, they have been taken out
        of our streams in such quantities as to be available for the purpose
        of pig-feeding and manure! Some economists estimate that only one egg
        out of every thousand becomes a full-sized salmon. Mr. Thomas Tod
        Stoddart calculated that 150,000,000 of salmon ova are annually
        deposited in the river Tay; of which only 50,000,000, or one-third,
        come to life and attain the parr stage; that 20,000,000 of these parr
        become in time smolts, and that their number is ultimately diminished
        to 100,000; of which 70,000 are caught, the other 30,000 being left
        for breeding purposes. Sir Humphry Davy calculated that if a salmon
        produced 17,000 roe, only 800 of these would arrive at maturity. It
        is well, therefore, that the female fish yields 1,000 eggs for each
        pound of her weight; for a lesser degree of fecundity, keeping in
        view the enormous waste of life indicated by these figures, would
        long since—especially taking into account the destructive modes of
        fishing that used a few years ago to be in use—have resulted in the
        extinction of this valuable fish.</span></p>

        to whether the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg
        165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>parr
        was or was not the young of the salmon—and arrived at a solid
        conclusion, was James Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd, who, in his usual
        impulsive way, proceeded to verify his opinions. He had, while
        herding sheep, many opportunities of watching the fishing streams,
        and, like most of his class, he wielded his fishing-rod with
        considerable skill. While angling in the tributaries of some of the
        Border salmon-streams, he had often caught the parr as it was
        changing into the smolt, and had, after close observation, come to
        the conclusion that the little parr was none other than the infant
        salmon. Mr. Hogg did not keep his discovery a secret, and the more
        his facts were controverted by the naturalists of the day the louder
        became his proclamations. He had suspected all his life that parr
        were salmon in their first stage. He would catch a parr with a few
        straggling scales upon it; he would look at this fish, and think it
        queer; instantly he would catch another, a little better covered with
        silver scales, but all loose, and not adhering to the body. Again, he
        would catch a smolt, manifestly a smolt, all covered with the white
        silver scales, yet still rather loose upon the skin, which would come
        off in his hand. Removing these scales, he found the parr with the
        blue finger-marks below them, and that the fish were young salmon
        then became as manifest to the shepherd as that a lamb, if suffered
        to live, would become a sheep. Wondering at this, he marked a great
        number of the lesser fish, and offered rewards (characteristically
        enough, of whisky) to the peasantry to bring him such as had
        evidently undergone the change predicted by him. When this conclusion
        was settled in his mind, the Shepherd at once proclaimed his
        new-gained knowledge. <span class="tei tei-q">‘What will the
        fishermen of Scotland think’</span> said he, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘when I assure them, on the faith of long experience and

        lost!’</span> These crude attempts of the impulsive Shepherd of
        Ettrick—and he was hotly opposed by the late Mr. Buist, of
        Stormontfield—were not without their fruits; indeed, they were so
        successful as quite to convince him that parr were young salmon in
        their first <a name="corr165" id="corr165" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The canned salmon,
        now generally popular in England, and which, though some few years
        ago an expensive luxury, is now within the reach of all, comes
        principally from the Columbia River, Oregon, and other parts of the
        North Pacific coasts. In North-Western America the fish is a perfect
        drug in the market. In a city like San Francisco it sells for eight
        cents (4d.) per pound. Higher up the coast a large fish is obtained
        for a quarter to half a dollar. Further north a piece of tobacco or a
        few needles will purchase a twenty or thirty pound salmon. They are
        so abundant that the writer has seen them on the beaches of streams
        and creeks falling into Frazer River, British Columbia, by the score,
        bleeding, gasping, and dying, having literally crowded each other out
        of the water. <span class="tei tei-q">“Schools”</span> of them are
        often so densely packed together, that they impede the progress of
        canoes and boats.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The salmon
        fisheries of the Columbia, Oregon, itself one of the grandest rivers
        in the world, give employment to 4,000 men during the season, and
        nearly all the canned salmon consumed in Europe comes from it.<a id=
        "noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href="#note_44"><span class=

        are dozens of rivers on the north-west coast equally available, and
        the business even now is in its infancy; while salted, pickled, or
        smoked salmon, hardly ever reaches England from there at all. As will
        appear, there are splendid opportunities on that coast for hundreds
        of new-comers, it may almost be said with or without capital. It is
        needless to state that the former is always to be preferred. Where
        isn’t it?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some ten or a
        dozen varieties of salmon and salmon-trout, Mr. Murphy tells us,
        enter the rivers of North-Western America, but only one is selected
        for commercial purposes. Two of the most delicate-eating
        varieties—the silvery-white and spring salmons—are never packed in
        tins, because their schools are less abundant and the fish themselves
        smaller. The hook-nosed and dog salmons are rarely eaten, except by
        Indians; while the man has not yet been discovered who would tackle
        the hump-back. The blue-back, or weak-toothed salmon, an inferior
        fish also, is only exported to the Sandwich Islands, where the
        natives are said to really prefer its lean and fibrous flesh to the
        more delicately-flavoured and succulent kinds. The salmon principally
        caught is distinguished by the Indians as the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Tyhee,”</span> or chief; it is abundant, large, and most
        excellent eating; it possesses those <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“all-round”</span> qualifications which particularly fit
        it for commerce and cooking. It is the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Salmo
        quinnat</span></span> of the naturalists.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fishery season
        on the Columbia lasts from the beginning of April to the end of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167"
        id="Pg167" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>July, and the fisheries extend
        along the river for a hundred miles or more. Some of the curing
        establishments employ their own men to tend the nets, while others
        purchase from fishermen, the price for fish weighing from fifteen to
        forty pounds ranging from 25 cents to 50 cents (approximately one to
        two shillings). These prices would seem ridiculously low were it not
        for the abundance of the fish and the ease with which they are taken.
        A party of four men may secure from 300 to 2,000 salmon in
        twenty-four hours! Take the lowest estimate—300 at 25 cents. This
        gives 75 dollars (or £15) to divide among the four fishermen. But
        this would be a very poor catch. A thousand fish are no uncommon
        haul. This at the lowest price paid would give 250 dollars (£50) to
        be divided. Of course there is the wear and tear of boat and fishing
        gear to be considered.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Large quantities
        of the fish are caught in weirs. The Indians, also, knowing that the
        salmon avoids currents if possible, build out into the river from the
        shore, for ten or a dozen feet, walls of stone a few inches in
        height. The salmon crowd into the quieter water caused thereby, and
        are easily captured in nets or by spearing. They are so numerous in
        places that the Indian can often flap them out of the water, by a
        sudden dexterous jerk of his paddle, to his squaw on the beach, who
        then immediately knocks them on the head and guts them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the curing
        houses, mostly owned by Americans, the labour is chiefly performed by
        Chinamen under the superintendence of white men. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“John”</span> quickly and cleverly guts the fish and cuts
        off its head; then cuts it into chunks, which are boiled, first in
        salt and afterwards in fresh water. Next the tins are filled, and
        soldered down, all but one little hole in their tops. The tins are
        then immersed in boiling water, and when every particle of air is
        excluded, a few drops of solder effectually seal them up till wanted
        for the table. The process is in effect the same employed in the
        preservation of meats and fruits in tins.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many British and
        Irish waterfalls are celebrated for their salmon leaps. In
        Inverness-shire at Kilmorack, at Ballyshannon in Donegal, and Leixlip
        near Dublin, in Pembrokeshire and elsewhere, the leaps are noted, and
        at many of them there are osier baskets placed below to catch the
        fish when they fail and fall. Sportsmen have even shot them, on the
        wing as it were, in their leap. At the Falls of Kilmorack
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord Lovat conceived the idea of placing a
        furnace and frying-pan on a point of rock overhanging the river.
        After their unsuccessful effort some of the unfortunate salmon would
        fall accidentally into the frying-pan. The noble lord could thus
        boast that the resources of his country were so abundant, that on
        placing a furnace and frying-pan on the banks of its rivers, the
        salmon would leap into it of their own accord, without troubling the
        sportsman to catch them. It is more probable, however, that Lord
        Lovat knew that the way to enjoy salmon in perfection is to cook it
        when fresh from the water, and before the richer parts of the fish
        have ceased to curd.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In our own land,
        the Tweed, Tay, Spey, and Severn, are all noted rivers for salmon;
        the Tay fish sometimes weigh sixty pounds. It is a curious fact that
        the full-grown salmon never feeds in the rivers. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Juvenile experience on the part of the fish, recurring
        as a phantasm, causes them to snap at a shining artificial minnow or
        a gaudy fly, but they never rise out of the water; the bait must dip
        to them, and when hooked they shake <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        Their superabundant store of fat enables them to live on themselves,
        as it were, as do the Asiatic and African doomba sheep when
        avalanches and heavy snow-falls stop their supplies of herbage.<a id=

        become much thinner during their stay in fresh water; their colour
        becomes duller, and their flavour much depreciated. Izaak Walton’s
        statement that <span class="tei tei-q">“the further they get from the
        sea they be both fatter and better”</span> is utterly erroneous, for
        they fatten only in the sea. In March, 1845, the Duke of Athole took
        a ten-pound salmon in the Tay after it had spawned, and attached a
        medal to it and then let it go to sea. The same individual, with its
        decoration, was fished up five weeks and a few days afterwards, when
        it had been to the refreshing salt water. It had more than doubled
        its weight, for it weighed twenty-one pounds.</p><a name="illo_187"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A great and
        important group of the bony fish is comprised under the family name
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Clupedæ</span></span>. It includes such useful
        fish as the herring, pilchard, shad, and anchovy. The family is as
        interesting to the merchant as to the gastronomist.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The herring hardly
        needs description here, but it may just be remarked, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">en
        passant</span></span>, that its back, indigo-coloured after death, is
        greenish during life. The curious markings often found on the herring
        have been considered by ignorant fishermen to signify mysterious
        words of cabalistic import. On one November day, near three hundred
        years ago, two herrings were caught on the coast of Norway, which
        bore marks resembling Gothic printed <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>characters. <span class="tei tei-q">“They were
        presented to the then King of Norway, Frederick II., who was so
        frightened by the characters he saw on the backs of the innocent fish
        that he turned ghastly pale, for he thought that they announced his
        approaching death and that of his queen.”</span> A council of
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">savants</span></span> was convened, and the
        learned ones solemnly reported that the words implied, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Very soon you will cease to fish herrings, as well as
        other people.”</span> Some more politic scientists gave another
        explanation, but it was useless, for the king died next year, and his
        late subjects became firmly convinced that the two herrings had been
        celestial messengers charged to announce that monarch’s sudden
        end.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The herring
        abounds in the entire Northern Ocean from the coasts of France and
        England to Greenland and Lapland. They are very gregarious, and
        travel in immense shoals, their appearance in any specified locality
        being uncertain and always sudden. On the coast of Norway the
        electric telegraph is used to announce to the fishing towns the
        approach of the shoals, which can always be perceived at a distance
        by the wave they raise. In the fiords of Norway the herring fisheries
        are the principal means of existence for the seaboard population. So
        in 1857 the paternal Norwegian Government laid a submarine cable
        round the coast 100 miles in length, with stations ashore at
        intervals conveniently placed for the purpose of notifying the
        fishermen. In Holland the industries of catching and curing the fish
        are highly profitable; the fishery is in consequence known as
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the great,”</span> while whaling is known as
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“small fishery.”</span> To a simple Dutch
        fisherman, George Benkel, who died in 1397, Holland owes the
        introduction of the art of preserving and curing the herring. Two
        hundred years after his death, the Emperor Charles V. solemnly ate a
        herring on his tomb, as homage to the memory of the creator of a
        great national industry.</p><a name="illo_188" id="illo_188" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In our country
        there is also an important trade in the fish. Yarmouth sends out 400
        vessels of from forty to sixty tons, the larger carrying a crew of
        twelve. In 1857 three fishing boats of this seaport brought home
        3,762,000 fish. In Scotland the one town of Wick had a few years ago
        920 boats employed in the fisheries.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Dutch use
        lines 500 feet in length, with fifty or more nets to each. The upper
        part of these nets is buoyed with empty barrels or cork, while they
        are kept down by lead or stone weights; they can be lowered by
        lengthening the cord to which the buoys are attached. The meshes of
        the nets are so arranged that if the herring is too small to be
        caught in the first meshes, he passes through and gets caught in the
        succeeding one. Dr. Bertram went out in a Wick boat to the fishing
        grounds. He says:—<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg
        170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-q">“At last, after a
        lengthened cruise, our commander, who had been silent for half an
        hour, jumped up and called to action. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Up
        men, and at them!’</span> was the order of the night. The
        preparations for shooting the nets at once began by lowering sail.
        Surrounding us on all sides was to be seen a moving world of boats;
        many with sails down, their nets floating in the water, and their
        crews at rest. Others were still flitting uneasily about, their
        skippers, like our own, anxious to shoot in the right place.
        By-and-by we were ready; the <span class="tei tei-q">‘dog,’</span> a
        large inflated bladder to mark the far end of the train, is heaved
        overboard, and the nets, breadth after breadth, follow as fast as the
        men can pay them out, till the immense train is all in the water,
        forming a perforated wall a mile long and many feet in depth, the
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘dog’</span> and the marking bladder,
        floating and dipping in long zig-zag lines, reminding one of the
        imaginary coils of the great sea-serpent. After three hours of

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">began to pale their fires, and the grey dawn appearing
        indicated that it was time to take stock. We found that the boat had
        floated quietly with the tide till we were a long distance from the
        harbour. The skipper had a presentiment that there were fish in his
        net, and the bobbing down of a few of the bladders made it almost a
        certainty; and he resolved to examine the drifts. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Hurrah!’</span> exclaimed Murdoch of Skye; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘there’s a lot of fish, skipper, and no mistake.’</span>
        Murdoch’s news was true; our nets were silvery with herrings—so
        laden, in fact, that it took a long time to haul them in. It was a
        beautiful sight to see the shimmering fish as they came up like a
        sheet of silver from the water, each uttering a weak death-chirp as
        it was flung into the bottom of the boat. Formerly the fish were left
        in the meshes of the net till the boat arrived in the harbour; but
        now, as the net is hauled on board, they are at once shaken out. As
        our silvery treasure showers into the boat, we roughly guess our
        capture at fifty cranes—a capital night’s work.”</span> Wick boats
        are not, however, always so fortunate. The herring fleet has been
        overtaken more than once by fearful storms, when valuable lives,
        boats, and nets, have been sacrificed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Early in December,
        1879, an apparent epidemic of suicide attacked the herrings and
        sprats in Deal Roads, and they rushed ashore in such myriads at
        Walmer that the fishermen got tired of carting them off, and they
        were left on the beach for all who cared to help themselves. Nature
        seems now and then to put bounds to over-population, but if this be
        the case, no herring famines need be feared, for economical Nature
        would never have played into the hands of the fishermen who are
        always at war with her. Such wholesale suicides occur among other
        forms of animal life. In Africa regiments of ants have been seen
        deliberately marching into streams, where they were immediately
        devoured by fish. Rats have migrated in myriads, stopping nowhere,
        neither day nor night, and have been preyed upon by both large birds
        and beasts of prey. In the Seychelles some years ago several hundred
        turtles conspired to die together on the island in front of the
        harbour, and carried out their decision. Were they the victims of
        hydrophobia, delirium tremens, or some other disease? Even the gay
        and sprightly butterfly has been known to migrate in immense clouds
        from the land straight out to sea, without the remotest chance of
        ever reaching another shore. What could be the reason for such a
        suicidal act?</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg
        171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would be
        difficult to over-estimate the value of deep sea fisheries; in which,
        according to trustworthy statistics, England and Wales alone employ
        nearly 15,000 boats, with nearly double that number of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“hands,”</span> added to whom are over 14,000 others to
        whom they give occasional employment on the coasts. The report of
        Commissioners Frank Buckland and Spencer Walpole, who were instructed
        to investigate the modes of fishing in the two countries named, and
        how far they were conducted on proper principles, has therefore both
        importance and interest. It was feared that in certain directions
        deep-sea fishing, which undeniably leads to the capture of myriads of
        young and useless fish, might have the same effect as wasteful
        fishing and dredging did in the case of the salmon and oyster.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Commissioners
        assure us that there is neither ground for alarm nor for legislative
        interference. The beneficent sea is practically inexhaustible.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Bearing in mind,”</span> wrote a commentator
        on the Report, <span class="tei tei-q">“how much has been said
        regarding the wilful destruction of spawn, it is startling to hear
        that nobody <span class="tei tei-q">‘has ever seen the eggs of soles,
        turbot, plaice, and other like fish after their extrusion from the
        parent,’</span> while, with respect to the finny tribe in general,
        the Commissioners add: <span class="tei tei-q">‘So far as we know,
        there is, with one exception—herring spawn—no clearly-established
        instance of the spawn of any edible fish being raised in a trawl net
        or taken in any other net.’</span> With these words one bugbear of
        the sea disappears. Nature, whatever may be her shortcomings
        elsewhere, knows how to take care of herself here. She carries on her
        life-giving processes beyond our reach, and is veiled in a mystery
        which even the keen observation of the present time cannot penetrate,
        for the Commissioners remind us that, generally speaking,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘little is known either of the seasons in
        which sea fish spawn or of the places in which the spawn is cast;
        still less of the time which the spawn, after it is cast, takes to
        vivify.’</span> But if the spawn evades the power of man, the young
        fish are not so fortunate. It is unquestionable that an immense waste
        of fry of all kinds goes on round our coasts. The trawler, the
        shrimper, the seine net, and the fixed engine, combine against these
        little creatures, tons upon tons of which are annually destroyed. At
        first sight it would seem that a grave matter here presents itself.
        The Commissioners, however, proceed so to reason away its importance
        that in the end it assumes very small dimensions indeed. Starting
        from the indisputable fact that all animals have <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘a tendency to increase at a greater rate than their
        means of subsistence,’</span> Messrs. Buckland and Walpole go on to
        show that this especially applies to sea fish; and they take as an
        example the fecund herring. Assuming that the British waters contain
        sixty thousand millions of female herrings, each of which deposits
        twenty thousand eggs, it follows that the total number of eggs which,
        but for natural and artificial checks, would come to maturity is
        twelve hundred millions of millions—an expression which is easy to
        put on paper, but which the mind can no more comprehend than it can
        grasp the idea of eternity. Enough that these countless hordes, if
        compressed by five hundreds into foot cubes, would build a wall round
        the earth two hundred feet broad and one hundred high. The inference
        from such astounding figures is that man’s destructiveness can do
        little. He takes one herring for every half-million of eggs, while
        the original stock would be kept up were only one egg to mature out
        of ten thousand. All fish, it is true, are not as prolific as the
        herring, but the argument applies to each kind in its degree, and may
        be summed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg
        172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>up
        generally by the statement that the proportion of spawn and fry which
        must perish is so great as to reduce the operations of man to limits
        barely appreciable. On the important related question whether the
        supply of fish is decreasing, the Commissioners entertain no doubt
        whatever. They say, <span class="tei tei-q">‘so far from the stock of
        fish decreasing, we believe that the supply of fish, taken on the
        whole, is at least as great as it has ever been; there are some
        reasons for even thinking that it is actually increasing.’</span> On
        the other hand, they refer to a general impression that the take of
        flat-fish, such as soles and plaice, is becoming less; the local
        explanation referring almost universally to the destruction of fry.
        Yet while the Commissioners do not, except in the case of soles,
        contest the alleged decrease, they refuse to recognise the assigned
        cause, nor, generally speaking, do they see any reason for
        legislative action of a restrictive nature.”</span> The prospects of
        our ocean fishing, both as an industry and as a food supply, are,
        therefore, encouraging. The harvest of the sea is constant, and
        though there must be local fluctuations, the return for the labour of
        those <span class="tei tei-q">“who reap where they have not
        sowed”</span> is sure.</p><a name="illo_191" id="illo_191" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the shad,
        though not as commonly known as the herring, there are twenty known
        species. In the season this fish regularly approaches the mouths of
        great rivers for the purpose of spawning. It is found in the spring
        in the Rhine, Seine, Garonne, Volga, Elbe, and in many of our own
        rivers. In some Irish rivers the masses of shad taken have been so
        great that hardly any amount of exertion has been sufficient to land
        the net. It sometimes attains a very considerable size, weighing from
        four to six pounds. The shad taken at sea is considered coarser
        eating than that caught in rivers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sprat has been
        by some taken for the young of the herring, and the controversy on
        the subject has at times waxed warm. Some anatomists declare that
        their peculiarities show no difference but size. It has a serrated
        belly, which Bertram looks upon as the tuck in the child’s frock, a
        provision for growth. <span class="tei tei-q">“The slaughter of
        sprats,”</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“is as decided a
        case of killing the goose with the golden eggs as the grilse
        slaughter carried on in our salmon rivers.”</span> But Figuier
        reminds that writer that the young herrings are caught without the
        serrated belly, and that the curer’s purchase is regulated by the
        sprat’s rough, and the herring’s smooth, belly. Sprats are often so
        abundant as to be unsaleable, and are then actually used for
        manure.</p><a name="illo_192" id="illo_192" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pilchard
        visits our coasts at all times, the leading fisheries being in
        Cornwall. Wilkie Collins has given us a lively and interesting
        picture of the <span class="tei tei-q">“look-out”</span> for their
        approach and capture.<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46" href=
        "#note_46"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a> He says:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“A stranger in Cornwall, taking his first
        walk along the cliffs in August, could not advance far without
        witnessing what would strike him as a very singular and even alarming
        phenomenon. He would see a man standing on the extreme edge of a
        precipice just over the sea, gesticulating in a very remarkable
        manner, with a bush in his hand, waving it to the right and to the
        left, brandishing it over his head, sweeping it past his feet; in
        short, acting the part of a maniac of the most dangerous description.
        It would add considerably to the stranger’s surprise if he were told
        that the insane individual before him was paid for flourishing the
        bush at the rate of a guinea a week.<a id="noteref_47" name=
        "noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a> And if
        he advanced a little, so as to obtain a nearer view of the madman,
        and observed a well-manned boat below turning carefully to the right
        and left as the bush turned, his mystification would probably be
        complete, and his ideas as to the sanity of the inhabitants would be
        expressed with grievous doubt.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But a few words of explanation would make him alter his
        opinion. He would learn that the man was an important agent in the
        pilchard fishery of Cornwall, that he had just discovered a shoal
        swimming towards the land, and that the men in the boats were guided
        by his gesticulations alone in their arrangements for securing the
        fish on which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg
        174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>so
        many depend for a livelihood.”</span> These watchers are known
        locally as <span class="tei tei-q">“huers.”</span> They can easily
        detect the approach of the shoals, as they darken the water,
        producing the effect of a cloud. As they approach the fish may
        themselves be seen leaping and playing on the surface by hundreds;
        sometimes they are so abundant that the fish behind force those in
        front ashore, and they are taken by hand or in baskets.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The boats, each of
        about fifteen tons burden, carry a large, long seine net, kept up by
        corks and down by lead. The grand object in the fishery, guided by
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“huer”</span> on the cliffs ashore, is to
        drive the shoals into shallow waters and bays.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The grand object is now to enclose the entire shoal. The
        leads sink one side of the net perpendicularly to the bottom, the
        corks buoy the other to the surface of the water. When it has been
        taken all round the shoal, the two extremities are made fast, and the
        fish are imprisoned within an oblong barrier of netting. The art is
        now to let as few of the pilchards escape as possible while the
        process is being completed. Whenever the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘huer’</span> observes that they are startled, and
        separating at any particular point, he waves his bush, and thither
        the boat is steered, and there the net is shot at once; the fish are
        thus headed and thwarted in every direction with extraordinary
        address and skill. This labour completed, the silence of intense
        expectation that has hitherto prevailed is broken, there is a shout
        of joy on all sides—the shoal is secured.”</span> The seine is now
        regarded as a great reservoir of fish, and may remain in the water
        for a week or more. The pilchards are collected from it in a smaller
        net known as the <span class="tei tei-q">“tuck.”</span> When this net
        has travelled round the whole circuit of the seine, everything is
        prepared for the great event—hauling the fish to the surface.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Now all is excitement on sea and shore; every little
        boat in the place puts off crammed with idle spectators; boys shout,
        dogs bark, and the shrill voices of the former are joined by the deep
        voices of the <span class="tei tei-q">‘seiners.’</span> There they
        stand, six or eight stalwart, sunburnt fellows, ranged in a row in
        the seine-boat, hauling with all their might at the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘tuck’</span>-net, and roaring out the nautical
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Yo, heave ho!’</span> in chorus. Higher and
        higher rises the net; louder and louder shout the boys and the
        idlers; the <span class="tei tei-q">‘huer,’</span> so calm and
        collected hitherto, loses his self-possession, and waves his cap
        triumphantly. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Hooray! hooray! Yoy—hoy, hoy!
        Pull away, boys! Up she comes! Here they are!’</span> The water boils
        and eddies; the <span class="tei tei-q">‘tuck’</span>-net rises to
        the surface; one teeming, convulsed mass of shining, glancing,
        silvery scales, one compact mass of thousands of fish, each one of
        which is madly striving to escape, appears in an instant. Boats as
        large as barges now pull up in hot haste all round the nets, baskets
        are produced by dozens, the fish are dipped up in them, and shot out,
        like coals out of a sack, into the boats. Presently the men are
        ankle-deep in pilchards; they jump upon the benches, and work on till
        the boats can hold no more. They are almost gunwale under before they
        leave for the shore.”</span> At the little fishing cove of Trereen,
        Mr. Wilkie Collins tells us, 600 hogsheads, each of 2,400 fish and
        upwards, were taken in little more than a week.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sardine also
        comes under the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Clupedæ</span></span> family. It derives its
        commercial name from Sardinia, but is found all over the
        Mediterranean, the coast of Brittany, &amp;c. On the latter coast the
        fish are caught in floating nets, and arranged in osier baskets,
        layer after layer, each boat returning to port when it has secured
        25,000.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Space will not
        permit of more than a passing notice to the flat-fish, or
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Pleuronectidæ</span></span>. These fish swim by
        means of a caudal fin, and they can ascend or descend in the water
        readily, but they cannot turn to right or left with the same facility
        as other fish. Most flat-fish, soles, turbot, flounders, and plaice,
        are taken by trawl nets. Some of the larger are speared.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The holibut (or
        halibut) is a fish which attains a great size, sometimes as much as
        seven feet in length, and weighing 300 pounds. One brought to
        Edinburgh measured seven-and-a-half feet in length by three feet in
        breadth; it weighed 320 pounds. In Norway and Greenland a long cord,
        from which branch thirty or so smaller cords, each furnished with a
        barbed hook, is employed for their capture. The main cord is attached
        to floating planks, which indicate the place where it is let
        down.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gadidæ</span></span>
        family includes some most important fish, commercially considered,
        such as the whiting, haddock, and cod, the general form and
        peculiarities of which are familiar to all.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cod fish is a
        most voracious feeder, and is provided with a vast stomach; it eats
        molluscs, crabs, and small fish, and has been known even to swallow
        pieces of wood. It is essentially a sea fish, and is never seen in
        rivers. From the days of John Cabot, the English, French, Dutch, and
        Americans have prosecuted the great fisheries on the banks of
        Newfoundland; 2,000 English vessels, manned by 32,000 seamen, are
        employed in the pursuit. The modern cod-smack is clipper-built, has
        large tank wells for carrying the fish alive, and costs about £1,500.
        The fish is taken in nets, or by line. Bertram tells us that each man
        has a line of fifty fathoms in length, and attached to this are a
        hundred hooks, baited with mussels, pieces of herring, or whiting.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“On arriving at the fishing ground, the
        fishermen heave overboard a cork buoy, with a flagstaff about six
        feet in height attached to it. The buoy is kept stationary by a line,
        called the <span class="tei tei-q">‘pow end,’</span> reaching to the
        bottom of the water, where it is held by a stone or grapnel fastened
        to the lower end. To the <span class="tei tei-q">‘pow end’</span> is
        also fastened the fishing-line, which is then paid out as fast as the
        boat sails, which may be from four to five knots an hour. Should the
        wind be unfavourable for the direction in which the crew wish to set
        the line, they use the oars. When the line, or <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘taes,’</span> is all out, the end is dropped, and the
        boat returns to the buoy. The <span class="tei tei-q">‘pow’</span>
        line is hauled up with the anchor and fishing-line attached to it.
        The fishermen then haul in the line, with the fish attached to it.
        Eight hundred fish might be, and often have been, taken by eight men
        in a few hours by this operation; but many fishermen say now that
        they consider themselves fortunate when they get a fish on every
        fifth hook on an eight-lined <span class="tei tei-q">‘taes’</span>
        line.”</span> On our own coasts the cod is principally taken by
        deep-sea lines, with many shorter lines depending from them armed
        with large hooks. One man has in ten hours taken 400, and eight men
        have taken eighty score in one day off the Doggerbank. The Norfolk
        and Lincoln coasts afford a large supply; the fish taken is stowed in
        well-boats, and brought to Gravesend, whence they are transhipped
        into market boats and sent to Billingsgate. The store-boats with
        their wells, through which the water circulates, cannot come higher,
        as the fresh water of the Thames, and possibly some of that which is
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">not</span></span> too fresh, would kill the
        fish.</p><a name="illo_195a" id="illo_195a" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The haddock is

        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176"
        id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>numbers of fine haddocks are
        dried and smoked with the fumes of hard wood and sawdust. Hence the
        term, <span class="tei tei-q">“Finnan haddies,”</span> which, when
        obtained, are the finest for gastronomic purposes, being of superior
        flavour.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mackerel
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scomber
        scombrus</span></span>) is a most valuable fish for man. The tunny,
        bonita, and mackerel have yielded immense supplies of excellent food,
        the first-named being esteemed in parts of France far above any other
        fish. It is called the salmon of Provence. They attain a far larger
        growth than the mackerel, specimens having been found of seven,
        eight, and even nine feet in length, and weighing up to 400 pounds.
        They are specially abundant in the Mediterranean, where they are
        usually caught in nets. In Provence they are driven, much as are the
        pilchards in Cornwall, into an enclosed space called the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">madrague</span></span>,
        where at last the fish finds itself ensnared in shallow water. Then
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the carnage commences. The unhappy
        creatures,”</span> says Figuier, <span class="tei tei-q">“are struck
        with long poles, boat-hooks, and other weapons. The tunny-fishing
        presents a very sad spectacle at this its last stage; fine large fish
        perish under the blows of a multitude of fishermen, who pursue their
        bloody task with most dramatic effect. The sight of the poor
        creatures, some of them wounded and half dead, trying in vain to
        struggle with their ferocious assailants, is very painful to see. The
        sea red with blood, long preserves traces of this frightful
        slaughter.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bonita is
        principally a tropical fish, not unlike the mackerel, but more than
        double its size. It is the great enemy of the flying-fish, and
        possesses electrical or stinging powers, for any one attempting to
        hold the living fish is violently shaken as in palsy, and one’s very
        tongue is tied, and unable to make more than a spasmodic
        sputter.</p><a name="illo_195b" id="illo_195b" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mackerel is

        one of the most universally-esteemed fish.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mackerel is
        very voracious, and has courage enough to attack fish much larger
        than itself. It will even attack man, and is said to love him,
        gastronomically speaking. A Norwegian bishop who lived in the
        sixteenth century records the case of a sailor attacked by a shoal of
        mackerel, while he was bathing. His companions came to the rescue;
        but though they succeeded in driving off the fish, their assistance
        came too late; he died a few hours afterwards.</p><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This fish is
        generally taken by drift-nets, usually 20 feet deep, and 120 long,
        well buoyed with cork, but without weights to sink them. The meshes
        are made of fine tarred twine. They are in their best condition in
        June and July. The ancients used to make a sauce piquant from their
        fat, which was called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">garum</span></span>, and sold for the equivalent
        of sixteen shillings the pint. It was acrid and nauseous, but had the
        property of stimulating jaded appetites. Seneca charged it with
        destroying the coats of the stomach, and injuring the health of the
        high livers of his day. A traveller of the sixteenth century, Pierre
        Belon, found it highly esteemed in Constantinople.</p><a name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The formidable
        sword-fish is also tolerable eating, especially when young, and there
        are fisheries for its capture in the Mediterranean. The fishermen of
        Messina and Reggio fish by night, using large boats carrying torches,
        and a mast, at the top of which one of their number is stationed to
        announce the approach of their prey, which is harpooned by a man
        standing in the bows. This fish attains a length of five or six feet,
        its sword forming three-tenths of its length. It is one of the
        whale’s natural enemies, and it objects even to ships passing through
        its element. There are numerous cases cited of ship’s bottoms having
        been pierced by it. In 1725, some carpenters having occasion to
        examine a ship <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg
        178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>just
        returned from the tropics, found the sword of one of these animals
        buried in its lower timbers. They averred that to drive a pointed
        iron bolt of the same size to the same depth would require eight or
        nine blows with a thirty-pound hammer. It was further evident from
        the position of the weapon that the fish had followed the ship while
        under full sail; it had penetrated the metal sheathing and
        three-and-a-half inches of the timber.</p><a name="illo_199" id=

            FISHING FOR SWORD-FISH.
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now, before
        leaving the minor and intermediate types of ocean life for the
        monsters of the deep, a few general observations may be permitted.
        Pliny described 94 species of fish; Linnæus described 478; the
        scientists of to-day know upwards of 13,000, one-tenth of which are
        fresh-water fish. The reader will then understand why only a few of
        the more important, useful, or curious have been described in these
        pages.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A hard man of
        science once described fish-life as <span class="tei tei-q">“silent,
        monotonous, and joyless.”</span> Modern science has disproved each
        and all of these statements. As regards the first, there are species
        actually known which <span class="tei tei-q">“indulge in jews’-harps,
        trumpets, and drums.... Musical fish are a fact of positive
        knowledge, for not only can they be heard in shoals thrumming their
        jews’-harps in unison, but other kinds have been taken in the very
        act of trumpeting and drumming.”</span> Bertram, as we have seen,
        speaks of the <span class="tei tei-q">“death-chirp”</span> of the
        captured herring. The application of the telephone has proved that a
        fish, placed alone in some water, actually talked to itself! Mr. S.
        E. Peal, in a letter to a scientific journal, tells us of a large
        fish, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Barbes macrocephalus</span></span>, which
        converses with a peculiar <span class="tei tei-q">“cluck,”</span> or
        persuasive sound, which may be heard as far as forty feet from the
        water. He also mentions a bivalve of Eastern Assam which actually
        <span class="tei tei-q">“sings loudly in concert.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How fish-life
        could be called monotonous and joyless will puzzle any one who has
        watched them in a large aquarium, where their every movement tells of
        pleasure, or at least excitement. Imagine, then, their life in the
        ocean itself. All around them is life—life in constant activity. The
        ancients said, and Pliny assented to the dictum, that in the water
        might be found anything or everything that was found out of it, and
        as much more besides. Then there is the excitement of the chase, in
        which they may be either the pursued or the pursuers. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Not only,”</span> said a writer in a leading daily
        journal, <span class="tei tei-q">“can they indulge themselves in
        running away from sharks, as we should do from tigers if they swarmed
        in the streets, in contemplating the while the elephant of the seas
        sauntering along through his domain, or finding diversion and
        instruction in the winged process of the flying-fish or the
        tree-climbing of perch, the buffooneries of sun-fish and pipe-fish,
        the cunning artifices of the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘angler-fish,’</span> the electric propensities of some,
        the luminosity of others, the venomous nature of these or the
        grotesque appearance of those—not only is all the variety of
        experience to be found on the earth to be found also in the water,
        but even in a wider range and a greater diversity. The sea floor is
        strewn with marvels, and the rocks are instinct with wonders.”</span>
        Fish-life is, then, full of excitement and interest.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An accomplished
        ichthyologist, Mr. F. Francis, has stirred up the vexed question,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Do fish sleep?”</span> Only a very few fish,
        the dog-fish being one of the few exceptions, can close their eyes at
        all. Still, on the other hand, some human beings, and notably
        infants, can sleep with one or both eyes open, while the hare is
        credited with being able to take his nap in the latter condition.
        Fish would seem to require sleep from their constant activity; but in
        actual fact, no scientific watcher has yet caught one asleep.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some years ago,
        when an invalid wrote to Mark Twain seeking advice as to the value of
        fish as <span class="tei tei-q">“brain food,”</span> the answer of
        that humourist was plain indeed:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Fish-food
        is good: abounds in phosphorus and nutrition. In your case I must
        recommend a small whale!”</span> Unfortunately, Mark Twain fell into
        a very common error. The whale is <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></span> a
        fish; it is a mammal: it suckles its young. The writer has eaten
        whale—that is, a little bit of one. Whale brain, enclosed in batter,
        and treated as a fritter, is not to be despised.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The British whaler
        of about 1670 is quaintly described by Frederic Martin, who visited
        Spitzbergen and Greenland that year. He says:—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Whoever of the ships’ crews sees a dead whale cries out,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Fish mine!’</span> and therefore the
        merchants must pay him a ducat for his care and vigilance. Many of
        them climb often into the mast in hopes to have a ducat, but in vain.
        When the dead whale is thus fastened to the ship, two sloops hold on
        the other side of the fish, or whale, and in each of them doth stand
        a man or boy that has a long hook in his hands, wherewith he doth
        hold the boat to the ship, and the harpooner stands before in the
        sloop or upon the whale, with a leathern suit on, and sometimes they
        have boots on. Underneath the hook are some sharp nails fixed, that
        they may be able to stand firm. These two men that cut the fat off
        have their peculiar wages for it, viz., about four or five rix
        dollars. First they cut a large piece from behind the head, by the
        eyes, which they call the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kenter-piece</span></span>, that is as much as
        to say, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">winding-piece</span></span>; for as they cut all
        the other fat all in rows from the whale towards the end, so they cut
        this great <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kenter-piece</span></span> larger and wider than
        all the rest. This piece, when it is cut round about from the whale,
        reaches from the water to the cradle (that is, the round circle that
        goes round about the middle of the mast, and is made in the shape of
        a basket), whence you may guess of the bigness of a whale. A strong
        and thick rope is fixed to this kenter-piece, and the other end is
        fixed to underneath the cradle, whereby the whale is as it were borne
        up out of the water, that they may come at it, and by reason of the
        great weight of the whale the ship leans towards that side. One may
        judge how tough the fat is, for in this piece a hole is made, through
        which the rope is fastened, yet not deep into the fat, wherewith they
        turn the fish at pleasure. Then they cut another piece down hard by
        this, which is also hauled up into the ship, where it is cut into
        pieces a foot square. The knives used are, with their hafts, about
        the length of a man,”</span> and so on.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Brierly tells
        us that the most important natural enemy of the whale on the coast of
        Australia is the <span class="tei tei-q">“killer,”</span> a kind of
        large porpoise, with a blunt head and large teeth. These <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-q">“killers”</span>
        often attack the whale, and worry it like a pack of dogs, and
        sometimes kill it. The whalemen regard these creatures as important
        allies, for when they see from the look-out that a whale has been
        <span class="tei tei-q">“hove-to”</span> by them they are pretty sure
        of capturing it. The killers show no fear of the boats, but will
        attack the whale at the same time; and if a boat is stove in, which
        often happens, they will not hurt the men when in the water. The
        Australian natives about Twofold Bay say the killers are the spirits
        of their own people, and when they see them will pretend to point out
        particular individuals they have known. Some are very large,
        exceeding twenty-five feet; they blow from the head, in the same
        manner as the whale.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The homes of
        whales are hardly known. Where the northern whale breeds has long
        been a puzzling question among whalemen. It is a cold-water animal.
        Maury asks:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Is the nursery for the great
        whale in the Polar Sea, which has been so set about and hemmed in
        with a ledge of ice that man may not trespass there? This
        providential economy still further prompts the question, Whence comes
        all the food for the young whales there? Do the teeming whalers of
        the Gulf Stream convey it there also, in channels so far in the
        depths of the sea that no enemy may waylay and spoil it in the long
        journey? It may generally be believed that the northern whale, which
        is now confined to the Polar Sea, descended annually into the
        temperate region of the Atlantic, as far as the Bay of Biscay, and
        that it was only the persecution of the whale-fishers which compelled
        it to seek its frozen retreat. This opinion is now shown to be
        erroneous, and to have rested only on the confounding of two distinct
        species of whale. Like other whales, the northern is migratory, and
        changes its quarters according to the seasons; and the systematic
        registers of the Danish colonists of Greenland show that often the
        same individual appears at the same epoch in the same fiord. The
        females of the southern whale visit the coasts of the Cape in June to
        bring forth their young, and return to the high seas in August or
        September. It was supposed that the migration of the northern whale
        was for a similar purpose. This, however, is not now considered to be
        the case. Its movements are attributed to climatal changes alone, and
        especially to the transport of ice into Baffin’s Bay. It lives
        entirely in the midst of glaciers, and therefore is found in the
        south during winter and in the north during summer. The whale-fishery
        has diminished its numbers, but not altered its mode of life. It is
        stated now that the whale believed to have visited the North Atlantic
        Ocean is a totally different species, a much more violent and
        dangerous animal than the northern whale, also smaller, and less rich
        in oil. The fishery for the latter ceased towards the end of the last
        century, but it is thought to be not wholly extinct. On September
        17th, 1854, a whale, with its little one, appeared before St.
        Sebastian, in the Bay of Biscay; the mother <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>escaped, but the young one was taken, and from a
        drawing of a skeleton of the latter MM. Eschricht and Rheinhardt, of
        Copenhagen, are convinced that it belonged to a species distinct from
        the Greenland whale; so that the name of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Mysticete’</span> has been applied to various
        whales.”</span></p><a name="illo_200" id="illo_200" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sperm whale,
        says Maury, is a warm water animal; the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">right</span></span>
        whale delights in cold water. The log-books of the American whalers
        show that the torrid zone is to the right whale as a sea of fire,
        through which it cannot pass; and that the right whale of the
        northern hemisphere and that of the southern are two different
        animals; and that the sperm whale has never been known to double the
        Cape of Good Hope—he doubles Cape Horn.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Beale has done
        more to elucidate the habits and form of this whale than any other
        writer. Its great peculiarity of form is the head, presenting a very
        thick, blunt extremity, about a third of the whole length of the
        animal. The head, viewed in front, has a broad, flattened surface,
        rounded and contracted above, considerably expanded on the sides, and
        gradually contracted below, resembling in some degree the cut-water
        of a ship. On the right <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg
        182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>side
        of the nose is a cavity for secreting and containing an oily fluid,
        which after death concretes into the substance called spermaceti, of
        which in a large whale there is not unfrequently a ton. The mouth
        extends nearly the whole length of the head, and the throat is
        capacious enough to give passage to the body of a man, presenting a
        strong contrast to the contracted gullet of the Greenland whale.
        Immediately beneath the black skin of the sperm whale is the blubber,
        or fat, termed <span class="tei tei-q">“the blanket,”</span> of a
        light yellowish colour, producing when melted the sperm oil. A
        specimen taken in 1829 near Whitstable measured sixty-two feet in
        length. The oil was worth £320, exclusive of the spermaceti.<a id=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This whale
        swallows quantities of small fishes, and has been known to eject from
        its stomach a fish as large as a moderate-sized salmon. This species
        is gregarious; and the herds, called <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“schools,”</span> are females and young males. Mr. Beale
        saw 500 or 600 in one school. With each female school are one to
        three large <span class="tei tei-q">“bulls,”</span> or <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“schoolmasters,”</span> as they are termed by the
        whalers. The full-grown males almost always go in search of food. A
        large whale will yield eighty, and sometimes one hundred, barrels of
        oil. Among the habits of the whale are <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“breaching,”</span> or leaping clear out of the water and
        falling back on its side, so that the breach may be seen on a clear
        day from the mast-head at six miles’ distance; in <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“going ahead”</span> the whale attains ten or twelve
        miles an hour, which Mr. Beale believes to be its greatest velocity;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“lob-tailing”</span> is lashing the water
        with its tail. The dangers and hairbreadth escapes in the capture are
        very numerous.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1839 there were
        discovered among rubbish in a tower of Durham Castle the bones of a
        sperm whale, which, from a letter of June 20th, 1661, in the Surtees
        Collection, is shown to have been cast ashore at that time, and
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">skeletonised</span></span> in order to ornament
        this old tower. Clusius describes, in 1605, a sperm whale thrown
        ashore seven years before, near Scheveling, where Cuvier supposed its
        head to be still preserved, and there is an antiquity of the kind
        still shown there.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The whale chase is
        an exciting scene. Sometimes the whale places himself in a
        perpendicular position, with the head downwards, and rearing his tail
        on high, beats the water with awful violence. The sea foams, and
        vapours darken the air; the lashing is heard several miles off, like
        the roar of a distant tempest. Sometimes he makes an immense spring,
        and rears his whole body above the waves, to the admiration of the
        experienced whaler, but to the terror of those who see for the first
        time this astonishing spectacle. Other motions, equally expressive of
        his boundless strength, attract the attention of navigators at the
        distance of miles. The whole structure of the whale exhibits most
        admirable adaptation to his situations and the element in which he
        lives, in the toughness and thickness of his skin and disposition of
        the coating of blubber beneath, which serves the purpose—if we may be
        permitted to use so homely a simile—of an extra great-coat to keep
        him warm, and prevent his warm red blood from being chilled by the
        icy seas. But provision is especially made to enable him to descend
        uninjured to very great depths. The orifices of the nostrils are
        closed by valves, wonderfully suited to keep out the water from the
        lungs, notwithstanding the pressure. In one species <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>they are shaped like cones, which fit into
        the orifice like corks in the neck of a bottle, and the greater the
        pressure the tighter they hold. The most surprising fact in the
        whale, probably, is the power of descending to enormous depths below
        the surface of the sea, and sustaining that almost inconceivable
        pressure of the superincumbent water. On one occasion which fell
        under Mr. Scoresby’s own observation a whale was struck from a boat.
        The animal instantly descended, dragging down with him a rope nearly
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">one mile
        long</span></span>. Having let out this much of the rope, the
        situation of the boat’s crew became critical. Either they must have
        cut the line, and submitted to a very serious loss, or have run the
        risk of being dragged under water by the whale. The men were desired
        to retire to the stern, to counterbalance the pulls of the whale,
        which dragged the bow down sometimes to within an inch of the water.
        In this dangerous dilemma the boat remained some time, vibrating up
        and down with the tugs of the monster, but never moving from the
        place where it lay when the harpoon was first thrown. This fact
        proves that the whale must have descended at once perpendicularly, as
        had he advanced in any direction he must have pulled the boat along
        with him. Mr. Scoresby and the crew were rescued by the timely
        arrival of another boat furnished with fresh ropes and harpoons. A
        whale when struck will dive sometimes to a depth of 800 fathoms; and
        as the surface of a large animal may be estimated at 1,500 square
        feet, at this depth it will have to sustain a pressure equal to
        211,000 tons. The transition from that which it is exposed to at the
        surface, and which may be taken at about 1,300 tons, to so enormous
        an increase, must be productive of the utmost exhaustion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Strange incidents
        are related of harpooning. On September 24th, 1864, as the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Alexander</span></span>, belonging to Dundee,
        was steaming about in Davis’s Straits, a whale of about twelve tons
        was observed not far distant from her. Boats were put out, and the
        crew secured the animal. When they cleansed it, they found embedded
        in its body, two or three inches beneath the skin, a piece of a
        harpoon about eighteen inches long; on the one side were engraved the
        words—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Traveller</span></span>,”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Peterhead</span></span>, and on the other,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“1838.”</span> This vessel was lost in 1856,
        in the Cumberland Straits whale-fishery; it is therefore clear that
        the harpoon must have remained in the animal from that time.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A sailor gives the
        following description of sleeping <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">inside</span></span> a
        whale; not, however, quite as Jonah may have done. He says:<a id=

        were on a little expedition in the long-boat one voyage, and we had
        to encamp for the night with as much comfort as our scant means would
        afford. The shore was terrible for its wildness and desolation—it was
        indeed lonely, sad, and sandy, but what was strange and welcome, was,
        great carcases of whales, stranded like wrecks on the far-reaching
        shore, in some cases the backbone holding together like a good keel
        and the great ribs still round, giving you an idea of an elongated
        hogshead without the staves. We landed for the night, unbent our
        sails and stretched them over the bleached ribs of a whale’s
        skeleton, and after supper took a comfortable sleep under the most
        curious roof-tree I ever rested under.”</span> This was on the
        north-west coast of Africa; and the sailor came to the conclusion
        that whales come ashore to die. <span class="tei tei-q">“And to my

        it is welcome. I like <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg
        184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to
        think of these mighty travellers in the mighty deep hugging the shore
        when the fires of life burn low, and the mighty waves, their
        playmates from their childhood, giving their last lift up on the
        beach!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now for that
        great mythical or actual animal the sea-serpent.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For ages an animal
        of immense size and serpentine form has been believed to inhabit the
        ocean, though rarely seen. A strong conviction of its existence has
        always prevailed in Norway and the fiords, where it has been reported
        to have been frequently seen. It is also said that the coasts of New
        England have been frequently visited by this marine monster many
        times during this century.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Bishop
        Pontoppidan, who, about the middle of the eighteenth century, wrote a
        history of Norway, his native land, collected a quantity of
        testimonies as to its occasional appearance. Among other evidence he
        mentions that of Captain de Ferry, of the Norwegian Navy, who saw the
        serpent, while in a boat rowed by eight men, near Molde, in August,
        1774. A declaration of this was made by the captain and two of the
        crew before a magistrate. The animal was described as of the general
        form of a serpent stretched on the surface in <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185" id="Pg185"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>receding coils or undulations, and the
        head, which resembled that of a horse, elevated some two feet out of
        the water.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the summer of
        1846 many respectable persons stated that in the vicinity of
        Christiansand and Molde they had seen the marine serpent. The
        affidavits of numerous persons were given in the papers, which, with
        some discrepancies in minute particulars, agree in testifying that an
        animal of great length (from about fifty to a hundred feet) had been
        seen at various times, in many cases more than once. All agreed that
        the eyes were large and glaring; that the body was dark-brown and
        comparatively slender; and that the head, which for size was compared
        to a ten-gallon cask, was covered with a long spreading mane.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An account of one
        of these encounters, which took place on the 28th May, 1845, was
        published by the Rev. P. W. Demboll, Archdeacon of Molde, those
        present being J. C. Lund, bookseller and printer, G. S. Krogh,
        merchant, Christian Flang, Lund’s apprentice, and John Elgenses,
        labourer. These men were fishing on the Romsdal Fjord, and the
        appearance took place about seven in the evening, a little distance
        from shore, near the ballast place and the Molde Hove. Lund fired at
        the animal, which followed them till they came to shallow water, when
        it dived and disappeared.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1817 the
        Linnæan Society of New England published <span class="tei tei-q">“A
        Report relative to a Large Marine Animal, supposed to be a Serpent,
        seen near Cape Ann, Massachusetts, in August,”</span> of that year. A
        good deal of care was taken to obtain evidence, and the deposition of
        eleven witnesses of fair and unblemished characters were certified on
        oath before the magistrates. The length was estimated at fifty to a
        hundred feet, and the head compared to that of a sea-turtle, a
        rattlesnake, and a serpent generally, but in this case there was no
        appearance of a mane.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, in the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Boston
        Daily Advertiser</span></span> for November 25th, 1840, there is a
        communication from the Hon. T. H. Perkins of that city, attesting his
        own personal observation of the marine serpent at Gloucester Harbour,
        near Cape Ann, in 1817. This communication took the form of a letter
        written to a friend in 1820.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Captain Perkins
        speaks of the animal’s motion being the vertical movement of the
        caterpillar, and not that of the common snake either on land or
        water, and this confirms the account of Mr. M‘Clean, the minister of
        a parish in the Hebrides, who saw in 1809 a serpentine monster about
        eighty feet in length. He distinctly states that it seemed to move by
        undulations up and down, which is not only contrary to all that is
        known of serpents, but from the structure of their vertebræ
        impossible. Hans Egede mentions the appearance of a marine snake off
        the coast of Greenland in 1734.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 15th of
        May, 1833, a party, consisting of Captain Sullivan, Lieutenant
        Maclachlan and Ensign Malcolm of the Rifle Brigade, Lieutenant Lyster
        of the Artillery, and Mr. Ince the ordnance store-keeper at Halifax,
        started from that town in a small yacht for Mahone Bay, on a fishing
        excursion. When about half-way they came upon a shoal of grampuses in
        an unusual state of excitement, and to the surprise of the party they
        perceived the head and neck of a snake, at least eighty feet in
        length, following them. An account of this occurrence was published
        in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Zoologist</span></span> for 1847. The editor
        stated that he was indebted for it to Mr. W. H. Ince, who received it
        from his brother, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Great interest was
        excited in 1848 by an account of a great sea-serpent seen in lat. 24°
        44′ S., and long. 9° 20′ E., in the tropics, and not very far from
        the coast of Africa, by the officers and crew of her Majesty’s
        frigate <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Dædalus</span></span>. It was not, as in other
        cases, in bright and fine weather, but on a dark and cloudy
        afternoon, and with a long ocean swell. Captain Peter M‘Quhæ, in his
        report to the Admiralty, published in the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Times</span></span> for
        the 13th of October, describes it with confidence as <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“an enormous serpent, with head and shoulders kept about
        four feet constantly above the surface of the sea;”</span> and he
        adds: <span class="tei tei-q">“As nearly as we could approximate by
        comparing it with the length of what our main topsail-yard would show
        in the water, there was at the very least sixty feet of the animal
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">à fleur
        d’eau</span></span>, no portion of which was to our perception used
        in propelling it through the water, either by vertical or horizontal
        undulation. It passed rapidly, but so close under our lee-quarter
        that had it been a man of my acquaintance I should have easily
        recognised his features with the naked eye; but it did not, either in
        approaching the ship or after it had passed our wake, deviate in the
        slightest degree from its course to the south-west, which it held on
        at the pace of from twelve to fifteen miles per hour, apparently on
        some determined purpose. The diameter of the serpent was about
        fifteen or sixteen inches behind the head, which was without doubt
        that of a snake; and it was never during the twenty minutes that it
        continued in sight of our glasses once below the surface of the
        water; its colour a dark brown with yellowish white about the throat.
        It had no fins, but something like the mane of a horse, or rather a
        bunch of sea-weed washed about its back.”</span></p><a name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Drawings prepared

        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Illustrated London
        News</span></span> of 28th October, 1848. Lieutenant Drummond, the
        officer of the watch at the time, also printed his own impression of
        the animal, which differs in some slight points from the Captain’s
        account, particularly in ascribing a more elongated form to the head,
        in the mention of a back-fin (whereas Captain M‘Quhæ expressly says
        no fins were seen), and the lower estimate of the length of the
        portion of the animal visible. Lieutenant Drummond’s words
        are:—<span class="tei tei-q">“The appearance of its head, which with
        the back fin was the only portion of the animal visible, was long,
        pointed, and flattened at the top, perhaps ten feet in length; the
        upper jaw projecting considerably; the fin was perhaps twenty feet in
        the rear of the head, and visible occasionally. The Captain also
        asserted that he saw the tail, or another fin about the same distance
        behind it. The upper part of the head and shoulders appeared of a
        dark brown colour, and beneath the jaw a brownish white. It pursued a
        steady and undeviating course, keeping its head horizontal with the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187"
        id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>water, and in rather a raised
        position, disappearing occasionally beneath a wave for a very brief
        interval, and not apparently for the purposes of respiration. It was
        going at the rate of perhaps from twelve to fourteen miles an hour,
        and when nearest was perhaps 100 yards distant. In fact, it gave one
        quite the idea of a large snake or eel.”</span> Lieutenant Drummond’s
        account is the more worthy of regard, as it was derived from his
        journal, and so gives the exact impressions of the hour, while
        Captain M‘Quhæ’s description was written from memory after his

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These statements
        caused much discussion at the time. It was suggested by Mr. J. D.
        Morriss Stirling, a gentleman long living in Norway, and also by a
        writer in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Times</span></span> of November 2, 1848, under
        the signature of <span class="tei tei-q">“F. G. S.,”</span> that the
        monster had an affinity with the great fossil reptiles known to
        geologists as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Enaliosauria</span></span>, and particularly
        adduced the genus <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Plesiosaurus</span></span>, or gigantic lizard,
        with a serpent-like neck. This is also the opinion of Professor
        Agassiz, as given in the report of his lectures in Philadelphia, in
        1849, and reaffirmed in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Geological
        Researches.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A master in
        science, Professor Richard Owen, now appeared upon the field, and in
        a most able article in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Times</span></span>, November 11, 1848, gave his
        verdict against the serpentine character of the animal, and
        pronounced it to have been, in his judgment, a seal. He argued this
        partly from the description of its appearance, and partly from the
        fact that no remains of any dead marine serpent had ever been found.
        He says: <span class="tei tei-q">“On weighing the question whether
        creatures meriting the name of <span class="tei tei-q">‘great sea
        serpent’</span> do exist, or whether any of the gigantic marine
        saurians of the secondary deposits may have continued to live up to
        the present time, it seems to me less probable that no part of the
        carcase of such reptiles should have ever been discovered in a recent
        or unfossilised state, than that men should have been deceived by a
        cursory view of a partly submerged and rapidly moving animal, which
        might only be strange to themselves. In other words, I regard the
        negative evidence from the utter absence of any of the recent remains
        of great sea serpents, Krakens, or Enaliosauria, as stronger against
        their actual existence than the positive statements which have
        hitherto weighed with the public mind in favour of their existence. A
        larger body of evidence from eye-witnesses might be got together in
        proof of ghosts than of the sea serpent.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However, Captain
        M‘Quhæ gallantly returned to the charge, and combated the idea that
        he had mistaken one of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Phoca</span></span> species for a snake; and he
        was strongly corroborated by Mr. R. Davidson, Superintending Surgeon,
        Nagpore Subsidiary Force, in a letter from Kamptee, published in the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bombay
        Bi-monthly Times</span></span>, for January, 1849. This gentleman
        says that an animal, <span class="tei tei-q">“of which no more
        generally correct description could be given than that by Captain
        M‘Quhæ,”</span> passed within thirty-five yards of the ship
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Royal
        Saxon</span></span> while he and its commander, Captain Petrie, were
        standing on the poop, when they were returning to India in 1829.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, a letter
        was printed in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Zoologist</span></span> for 1852, communicated
        by Captain Steele, 9th Lancers, to his brother, Lieutenant-Colonel
        Steele of the Coldstream Guards, stating that while on his way to
        India in the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Bartram</span></span> he and <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">every one on
        board</span></span> saw <span class="tei tei-q">“the head and neck of
        an enormous snake.”</span> This was corroborated in a letter from one
        of the officers of the ship, who says:—<span class="tei tei-q">“His
        head appeared to be about sixteen feet above the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>water, and he kept moving it up and down,
        sometimes showing his enormous neck, which was surmounted with a huge
        crest in the shape of a saw.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another theory was
        put forward in the London <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Sun</span></span> of the 9th July, 1849, by
        Captain Herriman, of the British ship <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Brazilian</span></span>, who, on the 24th
        February, 1849, was becalmed on almost the same spot that Captain
        M‘Quhæ saw his monster while on a voyage from the Cape of Good
        Hope.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I perceived,”</span> wrote Captain Herriman,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“something right abeam, about half a mile to
        the westward, stretched along the water to the length of about
        twenty-five to thirty feet, and perceptibly moving from the ship with
        a steady sinuous motion. The head, which seemed to be lifted several
        feet above the water, had something resembling a mane running down to
        the floating portion, and within six feet of the tail it forked out
        into a sort of double fin.”</span> On approaching in a small boat,
        however, Captain Herriman discovered that his monster was nothing
        more formidable than <span class="tei tei-q">“an immense piece of
        sea-weed, evidently detached from a coral reef, and drifting with the
        current, which sets constantly to the westward in this latitude, and
        which, together with the swell left by the subsidence of the gale,
        gave it the sinuous snake-like motion.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Times</span></span> of 5th February, 1858, a
        letter from Captain Harrington, of the ship <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Castilian</span></span>, stating that he and his
        crew had seen a gigantic serpent on the 12th December, 1857, about
        ten miles N.E. of St. Helena, brought out another witness on the
        sea-weed hypothesis. This was Captain Fred. Smith, of the ship
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Pekin</span></span>, who gave a very similar
        account to that of Captain Herriman, stating that in lat. 26° S.,
        long. 6° E., on the 28th December, 1848, he captured what he believed
        to be a serpent, but what turned out to be a gigantic piece of weed
        covered with snaky-looking barnacles.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This last
        imputation brought up <span class="tei tei-q">“An Officer of H.M.
        ship <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Dædalus</span></span>,”</span> whose testimony,
        in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Times</span></span> of 16th February, 1858, puts
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">hors de
        combat</span></span> the sea-weed theory in that renowned case. He
        states that, <span class="tei tei-q">“at its nearest position, being
        not more than 200 yards from us, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the eye</span></span>,
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the
        mouth</span></span>, the nostril, the colour and form, all being
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">most
        distinctly visible to us</span></span> ... my impression was it was
        rather of a lizard than a serpentine character, as its movement was
        steady and uniform, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">as if propelled by fins</span></span>, not by
        any undulatory power.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That there is some
        mighty denizen of the vasty deep, sometimes but seldom seen, is more
        than possible, and highly probable; but to which of the recognised
        classes of created being can this huge rover of the ocean be
        referred? First of all, is it an animal at all? On two occasions
        monstrous pieces of weed have been mistaken for the Kraken, but on
        each occasion the distance from the vessel is estimated at half a
        mile; while Captain M‘Quhæ says that he was within 200 yards, and Mr.
        Davidson within thirty-five yards of the animal. Under these
        circumstances we may fairly dismiss the sea-weed hypothesis.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Professor Owen
        would place the sea-serpent among the mammalia, but <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phoca
        proboscidea</span></span> is the only seal which will bear comparison
        with the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Dædalus</span></span> animal in dimensions, it
        reaching from twenty to thirty feet. The officers declare, however,
        that at least sixty feet of their animal was visible at the surface.
        Again, the fore paws of the seal are placed at about one-third of the
        total length from the muzzle, and yet no appearance of fins was seen.
        To continue, the great <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Phoca proboscidea</span></span> has no mane, the
        only seals possessing what may be dignified with the title being the
        two kinds of sea lions—the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Otaria jubata</span></span> and <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Platyrhynchus
        leoninus</span></span>—which are far too small to come into the
        count.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg
        189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is quite
        possible that the great unknown is a reptile, and his marine habits
        present no difficulty. In the Indian and Pacific Oceans there are
        numerous specimens of true snakes (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Hydrophidæ</span></span>), which are exclusively
        inhabitants of the sea. None of these, however, are known to exceed a
        few feet in length, and none of them, so far as is known, have found
        their way into the Atlantic.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most probable
        solution of the riddle is the hypothesis of Mr. Morriss Stirling and
        Professor Agassiz, that the so-called sea-serpent will find its
        closest affinities with those extraordinary animals the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Enaliosauria</span></span>, or marine lizards,
        whose fossil skeletons are found so abundantly through the Oolite and
        the Lias. If the Plesiosaur could be seen alive you would find nearly
        its total length on the face of the water propelled at a rapid rate,
        without any undulation, by an apparatus altogether invisible—the
        powerful paddles beneath—while the entire serpentine neck would
        probably be projected obliquely, carrying the reptilian head, with an
        eye of moderate aperture, and a mouth whose gape did not extend
        behind the eye. Add to this a body of leathery skin like that of the
        whale, give the creature a length <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>of some sixty feet or more, and you would have
        before you almost the very counterpart of the apparition that wrought
        such amazement on board the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Dædalus</span></span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In evidence of the
        existence of such an animal, Captain the Hon. George Hope states that
        when in H.M.S. <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Fly</span></span>, in the Gulf of California,
        the sea being perfectly smooth and clear, he saw at the bottom a
        large marine animal with the head and general figure of an alligator,
        except that the neck was much longer, and that, instead of legs, the
        animal had four large flappers, something like those of turtles.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two strong
        objections to this theory are—first, the hypothetical improbability
        of such forms having been transmitted from the era of the secondary
        strata to the present time; and, second, the entire absence of any
        parts of the carcases or unfossilised skeletons of such animals in
        museums. Many fossil types, however, of marine animals have been
        transmitted, with or without interruption, from remote geological
        epochs to the present time; among these may be mentioned the Port
        Jackson Shark (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Cestracion</span></span>), and the gar-pike
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Lepidosteus</span></span>), which have come down
        to us without interruption, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Chimæra percopsis</span></span> of Lake
        Superior, and soft-shelled tortoises (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Trionychidæ</span></span>), with more or less
        apparent disappearance. The non-occurrence of dead animals is of
        little weight as disproving the existence of the sea-serpent; its
        carcase would float only a short time, and the rock-bound coasts of
        Norway would be very unlikely to retain any fragment cast up by the
        waves; many whales being known to naturalists only from two or three
        specimens in many centuries.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conclusion of
        the best naturalists is that the existence of the sea-serpent is
        possibly a verity, and that it may prove to be some modified type of
        the secondary <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Enaliosaurians</span></span>, or possibly some
        intermediate form between them and the elongated <span class=

        stands gazing into a field or on a hedgerow bank, though studded with
        the most lovely flowers, by the half-hour together. But we can and do
        stand watching the sea, and feel reluctant to leave it: the changes
        of the tide and the ever rolling, breaking, and retiring waves are so
        much like the phenomena of life, that we look on with an interest and

        its precursor in serried ranks, ever coming nearer and nearer, ever
        looming larger and larger, like the resistless legions of a great

        parts of the shore where we can see this promontory. But very
        different is it on a close acquaintance. It is a wilderness of craggy
        points and huge castellated masses of compact limestone marble, piled
        one on another in the most magnificent confusion. We have secured a
        comfortable berth, where, wedged in between two of these masses, we
        can without danger lean and look wistfully down upon the very theatre
        of the elemental war. Is not this a sight worth the toil and trouble
        and peril of the ascent? The rock below is fringed with great insular
        peaks and blocks, bristling up amidst the sea, of various sizes and
        of the most fantastic and singular forms, which the sea at high water
        would mostly cover, though now the far-receding tide exposes their
        horrid <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name=

        the south-west; and as it approaches, with its huge undulations
        driven up into foaming crests before the howling gale, each mighty
        wave breasts up against these rocks, as when an army of veteran
        legions assaults an impregnable fortress. Impregnable, indeed! for
        having spent its fury in a rising wall of mingled water and foam, it
        shoots up perpendicularly to an immense elevation, as if it would
        scale the heights it could not overthrow, only to be the next moment
        a broken ruin of water murmuring and shrieking in the moats below.
        The insular blocks and peaks receive the incoming surge in an
        overwhelming flood, which immediately, as the spent wave recedes,
        pours off through the interstices in a hundred beautiful jets and
        cascades; while in the narrow straits and passages the rushing sea
        boils and whirls about in curling sheets of snowy whiteness, curdling
        the surface; or where it breaks away, of the most delicate pea-green
        hue, the tint produced by the bubbles seen through the water as they
        crowd to the air from the depths where they were formed—the evidence
        of the unseen conflict fiercely raging between earth and sea far

        while the foam, as it forms and accumulates around the base of the
        headland, is seized by the same power in broad masses and carried
        against the sides of the projecting rocks, flying hither and thither
        like fleeces of wool, and adhering like so much mortar to the face of
        the precipice, till it covers great spaces, to the height of many
        fathoms above the highest range of the tide. The gulls flit wailing
        through the storm, now breasting the wind, and beating the air with
        their long wings as they make slow headway; then yielding the vain
        essay, they turn and are whirled away, till, recovering themselves,
        they come up again with a sweep, only to be discomfited. Their white
        forms, now seen against the leaden-grey sky, now lost amidst the
        snowy foam, then coming into strong relief against the black rock;
        their piping screams now sounding close against the ear, then
        blending with the sounds of the elements, combine to add a wildness
        to the scene which was already sufficiently savage.</span></p>

        with a crash; the lightnings fall straight and serried—no longer a
        series of fantastic zig-zags, but a very focus of electric light.
        Sometimes the brilliancy flashes out behind the castle, and the
        outline of its square tower, black as ink, <span class="tei tei-pb"

        Sometimes the fire kindles in the east, and the square, the houses,
        the fortress, are all lighted up by a flame of unbearable white,
        which scorches the eyes. The air is rent by the winds in fury, the
        boom of the waves resounds through an undertone of wild complaint.
        Angels of destruction are passing by this night; one hears the hiss
        of their swords. What is human life? A nothing. What is man himself?
        A worm. In hours like these the boldest among us calls his ways to

        afternoon breeze died away into a calm, and allowing us from our
        vantage height to see far down into its depths. <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Presently I was gratified with the sight
        of one and then another of that enormous Medusa, the Great
        Rhizostome, urging its diagonal course at the shining surface. Its
        great bluish-white disc, like a globe of fifteen or eighteen inches
        in diameter, moves foremost by alternate contractions and expansions,
        which remind one of the pulse of an enormous heart, especially as at
        each stroke a volume of fluid is shot out of the cavity, by the
        impact of which on the surrounding water the huge body is driven
        vigorously forward. Meanwhile the compound peduncle, with its eight
        arms that hang down to the depth of two feet below, is dragged after
        the disc, its weight and the resistance of the water to its bulk
        combining to give that slanting direction which this great Medusa
        always assumes when in motion. We watched the great unwieldy
        creatures a long time, even till evening had faded into night, and
        were left almost the only wanderers on the hill. But what a night it
        was! So calm, so balmy, so solemnly still and noiseless; even the
        wash of the ripple at the foot of the cliff was hushed. There was no
        moon, but many stars were twinkling and blinking, and in the
        north-west a strong flush of light filled the sky, which was rapidly
        creeping along over the north cliffs. Then those cliffs themselves,
        all distinctness of feature lost in the darkness, stood like a great
        black wall in front of us, which being reflected in the placid sea so
        truly that no difference could be traced between substance and
        shadow, the dark mass, doubled in height, seemed to rise from a line
        only a few hundred yards off; and thus everything looked strange and
        unnatural and unrecognisable, although our reason told us the
        cause.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Let us now scramble down the cliff-side path, tangled
        with briers and ferns, where the swelling buds of the hawthorn and
        honeysuckle are already bursting, while the blackbird mellowly
        whistles in the fast-greening thicket, and the lark joyously greets
        the mounting sun above us. Yonder on the shingle lies a boat newly
        painted in white and green for the attraction of young ladies of
        maritime aspirations; she is hauled up high and dry, but the sinewy
        arms of an honest boatman, who, hearing footsteps, has come out of
        his little grotto under the rock to reconnoitre, will soon drag her
        down to the sea’s margin, and <span class="tei tei-q">‘for the sum of
        a shilling an hour,’</span> will pull us over the smooth and
        pond-like sea whithersoever we may choose to direct him.</span></p>

        seats on the clean canvas cushions astern, the boat’s bottom scrapes
        along with a harsh grating noise over the white shingle-pebbles, and
        we are afloat.</span></p>

        The lowness of the tide will enable us to take the boat into them,
        and the calmness of the sea will preclude much danger of her striking
        upon the rocks, especially as the watchful boatman will be on the
        alert, boat-hook in hand, to keep her clear. Now we lie in the gloom
        of the lofty arch, gently heaving and sinking and swaying on the
        slight swell, which, however smooth at the surface, is always
        perceptible when you are in a boat among rocks, and which invests
        such an approach with a danger that a landsman does not at all
        appreciate.</span></p>

        them adhering to the stone walls several feet above the water. Those
        have been left uncovered for hours, and are none the worse for it.
        They are closed, the many tentacles being concealed by the involution
        of the upper part of the body, so that they look like balls or
        hemispheres, or semi-ovals of flesh; or like ripe fruits, so plump
        and glossy and succulent and high-coloured, that we are tempted to
        stretch forth the willing hand to pluck and eat. Some are greengages,
        some Orleans plums, some magnum-bonums, so varied are their rich
        hues; but look beneath the water, and you see them not less numerous,
        but of quite another guise. These are all widely expanded; the
        tentacles are thrown out in an arch over the circumference, leaving a
        broad flat disc, just like a many-petalled flower of gorgeous hues;
        indeed, we may fancy that here we see the blossoms and there the
        ripened fruit. Do not omit, however, to notice the beads of pearly
        blue that stud the margin all around at the base of the over-arching
        tentacles. These have been supposed by some to be eyes; the
        suggestion, however, rests upon no anatomical ground, and is, I am
        afraid, worthless, though I cannot tell you what purpose they do
        serve.”</span></p><a name="illo_217" id="illo_217" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Gosse was
        reclining one evening on the turf, looking down on a Devonshire cove
        that formed the extremity of a great cavern. Though it was low tide,
        the sea did not recede sufficiently to admit of any access to the
        cove from the shore. Presently he saw a large rat come deliberately
        foraging down to the water’s edge, peep under every stone, go hither
        and thither very methodically, pass into the crevices, exploring them
        in succession. At length he came out of a hole in the rock, with some
        white object in his mouth as big as a walnut, and ran slowly off with
        it by a way the observer had not seen him go before, till he could
        follow him no longer with his eyes because of the projections of the
        precipice. What could he possibly have found? He evidently knew what
        he was about. From his retirement into the cavern, when the sea had
        quite insulated it, the sagacious little animal had doubtless his
        retreat in its recesses, far up, of course, out of the reach of the
        sea, where he would be snugly lodged when the waves dashed and broke
        wildly through the cove, kindling millions of fitful lamps among the
        clustering polypes below.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The influx of the
        tide is frequently, as we all know, very rapid on the sands, and cuts
        off the communication between rocky islets and the shore in rather a
        treacherous fashion. Mr. Gosse, in giving an account of such influx
        on a part of the Devonshire coast says:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“In the evening we strolled down to look at the place,
        and were beguiled into staying till it was quite late by the interest
        which attached to the coming-in of the tide. There was a <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>breeze from the southward, which hove the
        sea against the opposite entrance of the cavern to that on which we
        were standing; and the funnel-shaped cliffs on that side concentrated
        the successive waves, which drove through a sort of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘bore,’</span> and covered with turbulent water large
        tracts which but a few moments before were dry. We were pushed from
        stone to stone, and from spot to spot, like a retreating enemy before
        a successful army; but we lingered, wishing to see the junction of
        the waters and the insulation of the rock. It is at this point that
        the advance is so treacherous. There was an isthmus of some twenty
        feet wide of dry sand, when my wife, who had seen the process before,
        said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘It will be all over by the time you
        have counted a hundred.’</span> Before I had reached fifty it was a
        wide wash of water.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A melancholy fate
        overtook a large family party near here some years ago. They had
        walked over the sands to Fern Cliff, and made their picnic in a
        cavern close by, forgetful of the silent march of the tide. When they
        discovered their isolation escape was cut off, and the overhanging
        rock forbade all chance of climbing. They were all drowned, and the
        bodies picked up one by one, as the sea washed them in.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All the species of
        anemone found on the rocks above the water are to be seen below it,
        and all displaying their beauties in an incomparably more charming
        fashion. The whole submerged wall is nothing else than a parterre of
        most brilliant flowers, taken bodily and set on end. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The eye is bewildered with their number and variety, and
        knows not which to look at first. Here are the rosy anemones
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sagartia
        rosea</span></span>), with a firm fleshy column of rich sienna-brown,
        paler towards the base, and with the upper part studded with
        indistinct spots, marking the situation of certain organs which have
        an adhesive power. The disc is of a pale neutral tint, with a crimson
        mouth in the centre, and a circumference of crowded tentacles of the
        most lovely rose-purple, the rich hue of that lovely flower that
        bears the name of General Jacqueminot. In those specimens that are
        most widely opened this tentacular fringe forms a blossom whose
        petals overhang the concealed column, expanding to the width of an
        inch or more; but there are others in which the expansion is less
        complete in different degrees, and these all give distinct phases of
        loveliness. We find a few among the rest which, with the
        characteristically-coloured tentacles, have the column and disc of a
        creamy white; and one in which the disc is of a brilliant orange,
        inclining to scarlet. Most lovely little creatures are they all!
        Commingling with these charming roses there are others which attain a
        larger size, occurring in even greater abundance. They are frequently
        an inch and a half in diameter when expanded, and some are even
        larger than this. You may know them at once by observing that the
        outer row of tentacles, and occasionally also some of the others, are
        of a scarlet hue, which, when examined minutely, is seen to be
        produced by a sort of core of that rich hue pervading the pellucid
        tentacle. The species is commonly known as the scarlet-fringed
        anemone (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Sagartia miniata</span></span>). The inner rows
        of tentacles, which individually are larger than those of the outer
        rows, are pale, marked at the base with strong bars of black. The
        disc is very variable in hue, but the column is for the most part of
        the same rich brown as we saw in the rosy. Yet, though these are
        characteristic colours, there are specimens which diverge exceedingly
        from them, and some approach so near the roses as to be scarcely
        distinguishable from them.”</span> The loveliness of these submarine
        gardens cannot be over-rated.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Gosse tells us
        in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Tenby,”</span> of a veritable
        submerged forest near Amroth. Pieces of soft and decayed wood
        constantly come to the surface, and are called by the peasantry
        <span class="tei tei-q">“sea turf.”</span> It is very commonly
        perforated by the shells of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Pholas candida</span></span>, being ensconed
        therein as closely as they can lie without mutual invasion. Other
        pieces are quite solid, resisting the knife like the good old oak
        timbers of a ship. Occasionally, during storms, whole trunks and
        roots and branches are torn away, come floating to the surface of the
        sea, and are cast on the shore. Some of them have been found
        <span class="tei tei-q">“at the recess of the autumnal spring tides,
        which have marks of the axe still fresh upon them, proving that the
        encroachment of the sea has been effected since the country was
        inhabited by civilised man.”</span> Several kinds of trees, including
        elm, willow, alder, poplar, and oak, have been found among the large
        fragments cast up. An account of the encroachments of the sea on
        various parts of our coasts would fill a large volume.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Gosse well
        describes some of the Devonshire coast scenery. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Now,”</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“we are
        under Lidstep Head, a promontory in steepness and height rivalling
        its <span class="tei tei-q">‘proud’</span> opponents. I never before
        saw cliffs like these. The stratification is absolutely
        perpendicular, and as straight as a line, taking the appearance at
        every turn of enormous towers, castles, and abbeys, in which the
        fissures bear the closest resemblance to loopholes and doors. Great
        areas open enclosed as if with vast walls. The sea surface was
        particularly smooth, and we ventured to pull into one of these,
        exactly as if into a ruined castle or vast abbey; chamber opening
        beyond chamber, bounded and divided by what I must call <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">walls</span></span> of
        rock, enormous in height, and as straight as the architect’s plumb
        would have made them, with the smooth sea for the floor. If the tide
        had been high, instead of being low-water of a spring tide, we might
        have rowed all about this great enclosed court; but as it was, the
        huge square upright rocks were appearing above water, like massive
        altars and tables. The sea was perfectly clear, and we could look
        down to the foundations of the precipices where the purple-ringed
        Medusæ were playing. Altogether, it was a place of strange grandeur;
        we felt as if we were in a palace of the sea genii, as if we were
        where we ought not to be, and when a gull shrieked over our heads,
        and uttered his short, hollow, mocking laugh, we started and looked
        at one another as though something uncanny had challenged us, though
        the sun was shining broadly over the tops of those Cyclopean
        walls.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We left this natural palace with regret; but the tide
        was near its lowest ebb, and I wished to be on the rocks for whatever
        might be obtainable in natural history. The lads, therefore, gave
        way, and we swiftly shot past this coast of extraordinary sublimity.
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200"
        id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Presently we came to the Droch,
        where a more majestic cavern than any we had yet seen appears. Up on
        a beach of yellow sand its immense span is reared with a secondary
        entrance; the arch of uniting stone is thrown across with a beautiful
        lightness, and appears as if hewn with the mason’s chisel. Dark domes
        are seen within, far up in the lofty vaulted roof, and pools of
        still, clear glassy water mirror the rude walls. This is certainly a
        glorious cave.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Easiest of all
        maritime objects to collect are the so-called <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“sea-weeds,”</span> which the Rev. J. G. Wood rightly
        terms a <span class="tei tei-q">“miserable appellation,”</span> to be
        employed under protest. They are in reality beautiful sea-plants of
        oft-times delicate form and colour; and even the larger and commoner
        varieties have much of interest about them, some having actual uses.
        One of the first to strike the eye on almost any beach is the common
        bladder-wrack (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Fucus vesiculosus</span></span>), that dark
        olive-brown sea-weed familiar to all visitors to our coasts. It is
        distinguished by its air-vessels, which explode when trodden on or
        otherwise roughly compressed, and which are the delight of all
        youngsters at the sea-side. This slimy and slippery weed makes
        rock-walking perilous in a moderate degree, a fact which does not
        generally stop young British maidens and their companions from
        slipping about over its tangled masses. A larger species
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fucus
        serratus</span></span>) sometimes grows to a length of six feet. It
        is used as manure, and even as food for cattle; while it is excellent
        to pack lobsters, crabs, &amp;c., if they have to be sent inland.
        These and kindred <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">algæ</span></span>, the generic term for
        sea-weed, are known as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Melanosperms</span></span>, or black-seeded, so
        called from the dark olive tint of the seeds or spores from which
        they spring, and with which they abound.</p><a name="illo_222a" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The best time for
        the collector who would reap a harvest is at spring-tides, when, Mr.
        Wood tells us, an hour or two’s careful investigation of the beach
        will sometimes produce as good results as several days’ hard work
        with the dredge. <span class="tei tei-q">“It is better to go down to
        the shore about half an hour or so before the lowest tide, so as to
        follow the receding waters and to save time.”</span> The naturalist
        or amateur collector then finds at these low tides a new set of
        vegetation, contrasting with the more delicate forms left higher on
        the beach, as forest-trees with ferns and herbage. Huge plants, some
        of them measuring eleven feet in length, of the oar-weed
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Laminaria
        digitata</span></span>), are lying about in profusion. It is known by
        its scientific name on account of the flat thin-fingered fronds it
        bears. Its stem is used for handles to knives and other implements,
        so tough and strong is it. One good stem will furnish a dozen
        handles, and when dry it is as hard as horn.</p><a name="illo_221b"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the same
        group is to be found a most singular rope-like marine plant, hardly
        thicker than an ordinary pin at the base, where it adheres to the
        rock, but swelling to the size of a large swan’s-quill in the centre.
        When grasped by the hand it feels as though oiled, being naturally
        slimy, and covered by innumerable fine hairs. It is found from the
        length of one to twenty, thirty, and even forty feet. It may be
        mentioned that sea-weeds have no true roots, but adhere by discs or
        suckers. They derive their nourishment from the sea-water, not from
        the rock or soil.</p>

        they are among the most beautiful known to collectors. They are
        delicate, and some turn brown when exposed to too much light. Above
        low water-mark may be found growing largish masses of a dense,
        reddish, thread-like foliage, sometimes adhering to the rock, and
        sometimes to the stems of the great <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That popular author and extensive traveller, Baron
        Munchausen,”</span> says Mr. Wood, <span class="tei tei-q">“tells us
        that he met with a tree that bore a fruit filled with the best of
        gin. Had he travelled along our own sea-coasts, or, indeed, along any
        sea-coasts, and inspected the vegetation of the waves there, he would
        have found a plant that might have furnished him with the groundwork
        of a story respecting a jointed tree composed of wine-bottles, each
        joint being a separate bottle filled with claret. It is true that the
        plant is not very large, as it seldom exceeds nine or ten inches in
        height, but if examined through a microscope it might be enlarged to
        any convenient size.”</span> The scientific name of this marine plant
        signifies the <span class="tei tei-q">“jointed juice-branch.”</span>
        It may be found adhering to rocks, or large seaweed, and really
        resembles a jointed series of miniature red wine bottles.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The common
        coralline (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Corallina officinalis</span></span>) is also one
        of the red sea-weeds, although long thought to be a true coral. It is
        a curious plant; it deposits in its own substance so large an amount
        of carbonate of lime that when the vegetable part of its nature dies
        the chalky part remains. When alive it is of a dark purple colour,
        which fades when removed from <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>the water, and the white stony skeleton alone
        remains. It is, however, a true vegetable, as may be seen by
        dissolving away the chalky portions in acid; there is then left a
        vegetable framework precisely like that of other algæ belonging to
        the same sub-class. It is a small plant, rarely exceeding a height of
        five or so inches, but it grows in luxuriant patches wherever it can
        find a suitable spot.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A beautiful marine
        plant is the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Delesseria sanguinea</span></span>, with its
        beautiful scarlet leaves, the branches being five or six inches in
        length. It has a very <span class="tei tei-q">“ancient and fish-like
        smell,”</span> once noticed not to be forgotten. Then again every one
        will remember in the little seaweed bouquets and landscapes on card
        sold at the fashionable seaside watering-places, a gay, bright,
        pinky-red kind, which is sure to be remarked for its charming beauty.
        This is the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Plocamium coccineum</span></span>, which is
        found to be even more beautiful under the microscope, for it is there
        seen that even the tiniest branchlets, themselves hardly thicker than
        a hair, have each their rows of finer branches.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some seaweeds are
        eaten, as for example the so-called <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Carrageen,”</span> or Irish moss, which is used in both
        jelly and size, and is one of the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Rhodosperm</span></span> algæ. To preserve it
        for esculent purposes it is washed in fresh water and allowed to dry;
        it becomes then horny and stiff. If boiled it subsides into a thick
        jelly, which is considered nutritious, and is used by both invalids
        and epicures. Calico-printers use it for size. It is used, boiled in
        milk, to fatten calves.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A pretty little
        seaweed, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Griffithsia selacea</span></span>, has the
        property of staining paper a fine pinkish-scarlet hue when its
        membrane bursts. Contact with fresh water will usually cause the
        membrane to yield, and then the colouring-matter is exuded with a
        slight crackling noise.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Chlorosperms</span></span>, or green-seeded
        algæ, have the power of pouring out large quantities of oxygen under
        certain conditions, and are therefore very valuable in the aquarium.
        Among them are the sea-lettuce, before mentioned, the common sea
        grass, and a large number of smaller and more delicate forms.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If,”</span> says Mr. Wood, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        naturalist wishes to dry and preserve the algæ which he finds, he may
        generally do so without much difficulty, although some plants give
        much more trouble than others. It is necessary that they should be
        well washed in fresh water, in order to get rid of the salt, which,
        being deliquescent,<a id="noteref_53" name="noteref_53" href=
        "#note_53"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a> would
        attract the moisture on a damp day, or in a damp situation, and soon
        ruin the entire collection. When they are thoroughly washed the
        finest specimens should be separated from the rest and placed in a
        wide, shallow vessel, filled with clear fresh water. Portions of
        white card, cut to the requisite size, should then be slipped under
        the specimen, which can be readily arranged as they float over the
        immersed card. The fingers alone ought to answer every purpose, but a
        camel’s-hair brush and a needle will often be useful. When the
        specimen is properly arranged the card is lifted from the water,
        carrying upon it the piece of seaweed. There is little difficulty in
        getting the plants to adhere to the paper, as most of the algæ are
        furnished with a gelatinous substance which acts like glue and fixes
        them firmly down.”</span> If not, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>use of hot water will generally accomplish the
        desired end. Animal glue or gum-water cannot he recommended.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every visitor to
        the sea-shore has observed rocks drilled with innumerable holes,
        almost as though by art. A few good blows with a stout hammer on the
        chisel-head serve to split off a great slice of the coarse red
        sandstone. The holes run through its substance, but they are all
        empty, or filled only with the black fœtid mud which the sea has
        deposited in their cavities. These are too superficial; they are all
        deserted; the stone lies too high above low-water mark; we must seek
        a lower level. Try here, where the lowest spring-tide only just
        leaves the rocks bare. See! now we have uncovered the operators. Here
        lie snugly ensconced within the tubular perforations, great mollusca,
        with ample ivory-like shells, which yet cannot half contain the
        whiter flesh of their ampler bodies, and the long stout yellow
        siphons that project from one extremity, reaching far up the hole
        towards the surface of the rock.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We lift one from
        its cavity, all helpless and unresisting, yet manifesting its
        indignation at the untimely disturbance by successive spasmodic
        contractions of those rough yellow siphons, each accompanied with a
        forcible <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">jet d’eau</span></span>, a polite squirt of
        sea-water into our faces; while at each contraction in length, the
        base swells out till the compressed valves of the sharp shell
        threaten to pierce through its substance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Strange as it
        seems, these animals have bored these holes in the stone, and they
        are capable of boring in far harder rock than this, even in compact
        limestone. The actual mode in which this operation is performed long
        puzzled philosophers. Some maintained that the animal secreted an
        acid which had the power of dissolving not only various kinds of
        stone, but also wood, amber, wax, and other substances in which the
        excavations are occasionally made. But it is hard to imagine a
        solvent of substances so various, and to know how the animal’s own
        shells were preserved from its action, while, confessedly, no such
        acid had ever been detected by the most careful tests. Others
        maintain that the rough points which stud the shell enable it to
        serve as a rasp, which the animal, by rotating on its axis, uses to
        wear away the stone or other material; but it was difficult to
        understand how it was that the shell itself was not worn away in the
        abrasion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Actual observation
        in the aquarium has, however, proved that the second hypothesis is
        the true one. M. Cailliaud in France, and Mr. Robertson in England,
        have demonstrated that the Pholas uses its shell as a rasp, wearing
        away the stone with the asperities with which the anterior parts of
        the valves are furnished. Between these gentlemen a somewhat hot
        contention was maintained for the honour of priority in this valuable
        discovery. M. Cailliaud himself used the valves of the dead shell,
        and imitating the natural conditions as well as he could, actually
        bored an imitative hole, by making them rotate. Mr. Robertson at
        Brighton exhibited to the public living Pholades in the act of boring
        in masses of chalk. He describes it as <span class="tei tei-q">“a
        living combination of three instruments, viz., a hydraulic apparatus,
        a rasp, and a syringe.”</span> But the first and last of these powers
        can be considered only as an accessory to the removing of the
        detritus out of the way when once the hole was bored, the rasp being
        the real power. If you examine these living shells you will see that
        the fore part, where the foot protrudes, is set with stony points
        arranged in transverse and longitudinal rows; the former being the
        result of elevated ridges radiating from the hinge, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the latter that of the edges of successive
        growths of the shell. These points have the most accurate resemblance
        to those set on a steel rasp in a blacksmith’s shop. It is
        interesting to know that the shell is preserved from being itself
        permanently worn away by the fact that it is composed of arragonite,
        a substance much harder than those in which the Pholas burrows. Yet
        we see by comparing specimens one with another, that such a
        destructive action does in time take place, for some have the rasping
        points much more worn than others, many of the older ones being
        nearly smooth.</p><a name="illo_225a" id="illo_225a" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The animal turns
        in its burrow from side to side when at work, adhering to the
        interior by the foot, and therefore only partially rotating to and
        fro. The substance is abraded in the form of fine powder, which is
        periodically ejected from the mouth of the hole by the contraction of
        the branchial siphon, a good deal of the more unpalpable portions
        being deposited by the current as it proceeds, and lodging as a soft
        mud between the valves and the stone. Mr. Hudson, who watched some
        Pholades at work in a tide-pool in the chalk, observed the periodic
        ejection of the cloud of chalk powder, and noticed the heaps of the
        same material deposited about the mouth of each burrow. The
        discharges were made with no regularity as to time. Mrs. Merrifield
        records a curious fact:—<span class="tei tei-q">“A lady watching the
        operations of some Pholades which were at work in a basin of
        sea-water, perceived that two of them were boring at such an angle
        that their tunnels would meet. Curious to ascertain what they would
        do in this case, she continued her observations, and found that
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the larger
        and stronger Pholas bored straight through the weaker

        "tei tei-q">“is that object that lies on yonder stretch of sand, over
        which the shallow water ripples, washing the sand around it and
        presently leaving it dry? It looks like a stone; but there is a fine
        scarlet knob on it, which all of a sudden has disappeared. Let us
        watch the movement of the receding wave, and run out to it. It is a
        fine example of the great spinous cockle (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cardium
        rusticum</span></span>) for which all these sandy beaches that form
        the bottom of the great sea-bed of Torbay are celebrated. Indeed, the
        species <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name=
        "Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>is scarcely known
        elsewhere, so that it is often designated in books as the Paignton
        cockle. A right savoury <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">bonne bouche</span></span> it is, when
        artistically dressed. Old Dr. Turton—a great authority in his day for
        Devonshire natural history, especially on matters relating to shells
        and shell-fish—says that the cottagers about Paignton well know the
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘red-noses,’</span> as they call the great
        cockles, and search for them at low spring tides, when they may be
        seen lying in the sand with the fringed siphons appearing just above
        the surface. They gather them in baskets and panniers, and after
        cleansing them a few hours in cold spring-water, fry the animals in a
        batter made of crumbs of bread. The creatures have not changed their
        habits nor their habitats, for they are still to be seen in the old
        spots just as they were a century ago; nor have they lost their
        reputation; they are, indeed, promoted to the gratification of more
        refined palates now, for the cottagers, knowing on which side their
        bread is buttered, collect the sapid cockles for the fashionables of
        Torquay, and content themselves with the humbler and smaller species
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cardium
        edule</span></span>), which rather affects the muddy flats of
        estuaries than sand beaches, though not uncommon here. This latter,
        though much inferior in sapidity to the great spinous sort, forms a
        far more important item in the category of human food, from its very
        general distribution, its extreme abundance, and the ease with which
        it is collected. Wherever the receding tide leaves an area of exposed
        mud, the common cockle is sure to be found, and hundreds of men,
        women, and children may be seen plodding and groping over the sinking
        surface, with naked feet and bent backs, picking up the shell-fish by
        thousands, to be boiled and eaten for home consumption, or to be
        cried through the lanes and alleys of the neighbouring towns by
        stentorian boys who vociferate all day long, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Here’s your fine cockles, here! Here they are! Here they
        are! Twopence a quart!’</span> ”</span> It is on the north-western
        coast of Scotland, however, that the greatest abundance of these
        mollusca occurs, and there they form not a luxury but even a
        necessary of life to the poor semi-barbarous population. The
        inhabitants of these rocky regions enjoy an unenviable notoriety for
        being habitually dependent on this mean diet. <span class=

        ebb, and the long sandbanks are productive of cockles in an abundance
        which is almost unexampled. At that time (a year of scarcity) they
        presented every day at low water a singular spectacle, being crowded
        with men, women, and children, who were busily digging for these
        shell fish as long as the tide permitted. It was not unusual to see
        thirty or forty horses from the surrounding <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class=

        purpose of carrying away loads of them to distances of many miles.
        This was a well-known season of scarcity, and, without this resource,
        I believe it is not too much to say that many individuals must have
        died for want.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the easiest
        forms of collecting is from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">débris</span></span>, as it were, of fishermen’s
        nets and baskets; but it is exceedingly difficult to induce trawlers
        to bring home any of their <span class="tei tei-q">“rubbish.”</span>
        Money, that in general <span class="tei tei-q">“makes the mare to
        go”</span> in any direction you wish, seems to have lost its
        stimulating power when the duty to be performed, the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quid pro
        quo</span></span>, is the putting a shovelful of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“rubbish”</span> into a bucket of water instead of
        jerking it overboard. No, they haven’t got time. You try to work on
        their friendship; you sit and chat with them, and think you have
        succeeded in worming yourself into their good graces sufficiently to
        induce them to undertake the not very onerous task of bringing in a
        tub of <span class="tei tei-q">“rubbish.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The thing is not,
        however, utterly hopeless. Occasionally Mr. Gosse had a tub of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“rubbish”</span> brought to him; but much
        more generally worthless than otherwise. The boys are sometimes more
        open to advances than the men, especially if the master carries his
        own son with him, in which case the lad has a little more opportunity
        to turn a penny for himself than when he is friendless. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If ever,”</span> says Gosse, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“you should be disposed to try your hand on a bucket of
        trawler’s <span class="tei tei-q">‘rubbish,’</span> I strongly

        several occasions when examining the contents of shrimpers’ nets, a
        pretty little flat-fish, a constant inhabitant of sandy beaches and
        pools, and often found in company with shrimps, some of which it
        hardly exceeded in size, although sometimes reaching a maximum growth
        of four or five inches. Small as it is, it is allied to the
        magnificent turbot. The naturalist above mentioned took it home, and
        observed its habits at leisure. <span class="tei tei-q">“In a white
        saucer,”</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“it was a charming
        little object, though rather difficult to examine, because, the
        instant the eye with the lens was brought near, it flounced in alarm,
        and often leaped out upon the table. When its fit of terror was over,
        however, it became still, and would allow me to push it hither and
        thither, merely waving the edges of its dorsal and ventral fins
        rapidly as it yielded to the impulse.”</span> This is the Top-knot,
        so called from an elongation of the dorsal fin. The little Sand
        Launce, with its pearly lustrous sides, is a commonly-found fish on
        the shore. It has a remarkable projection of the lower jaws, a kind
        of spade, as it were, by the aid of which it manages to scoop out a
        bed in the wet sand, and so lie hidden. The Lesser Weever, called by
        English fishermen Sting-bull, Sting-fish, and Sea-cat, because of its
        power of inflicting severe inflammatory <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Land’s End has
        a particular interest to the reader of this work, for its very name
        indicates a point beyond which one cannot go, except we step into the
        great ocean. Round the spot a certain air of mystery and interest
        also clings. What is this ending place like? It is the extreme
        western termination of one of the most rugged of England’s counties,
        one which has produced some of her greatest men, and has always been
        intimately connected with the history of the sea. Cornwall has
        afforded more hardy sailors to the royal navy and merchant marine
        than any other county whatever, Devonshire, perhaps, excepted. One
        must remember her sparse population in making any calculation on this
        point. Her fishermen and miners are among the very best in the world.
        Some sketches therefore of Cornish coasts and coast life may be
        acceptable.<a id="noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the great
        features of the Land’s End is the famed Botallack Mine, which
        stretches out thousands of feet beyond the land, and under the sea.
        Wilkie Collins, in an excellent description of his visit to the old
        mine says:—<span class="tei tei-q">“The sight was, in its way, as
        striking and extraordinary as the first view of the Cheese-Wring
        itself. Here we beheld a scaffolding perched on a rock that rose out
        of the waves—there a steam-pump was at work raising gallons of water
        from the mine every minute, on a mere ledge of land half down the
        steep cliff side. Chains, pipes, conduits, protruded in all
        directions from the precipice; rotten-looking wooden platforms,
        running over deep chasms, supported great beams of timber and heavy
        coils of cable; crazy little boarded houses were built where gull’s
        nests might have been found in other places. There did not appear to
        be a foot of level space anywhere, for any part of the works of the
        mine to stand upon; and yet, there they were, fulfilling all the
        purposes for which they had been constructed, as safely and
        completely, on rocks <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg
        208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in
        the sea, and down precipices in the land, as if they had been
        cautiously founded on the tracts of the smooth solid ground
        above!”</span></p><a name="illo_232" id="illo_232" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Botallack is
        principally a copper and tin mine, and has in days gone by yielded
        largely. Mr. Collins descended it to some depth, and found the salt
        water percolating from the ocean above, through holes and crannies.
        In one place he noted a great wooden plug the thickness of a man’s
        leg driven into a cranny of the rock. It was placed there to prevent
        the sea from swamping the mine! Fancy placing a plug to literally
        keep out the Atlantic Ocean!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We are now,”</span> says Mr. Collins in his narrative,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“400 yards out <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">under the bottom of the
        sea</span></span>, and twenty fathoms, or 120 feet below the sea
        level. Coast trade vessels are sailing over our heads. Two hundred
        and forty feet beneath us men are at work, and there are galleries
        deeper yet, even below that.... After listening for a few moments, a
        distant, unearthly noise becomes faintly audible—a long, low,
        mysterious moaning, that never changes, that is felt on the ear as
        well as heard by it—a sound that might proceed from some incalculable
        distance—from some far invisible height—a sound unlike anything that
        is heard on the upper ground, in the free air of heaven, a sound so
        sublimely mournful and still, so ghostly and impressive when listened
        to in the subterranean recesses of the earth, that we continue
        instinctively to hold our peace, as if enchanted by it, and think not
        of communicating to each other the strange awe and astonishment which
        it has inspired in us both from the very first.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“At last the miner speaks again, and tells us that what
        we hear is the sound of the surf lashing the rocks a hundred and
        twenty feet above us, and of the waves that are breaking on the beach
        beyond. The tide is now at the flow, and the sea is in no
        extraordinary state of agitation, so the sound is low and distant
        just at this period. But when storms are at their height, when the
        ocean hurls mountain after mountain of water on the cliffs, then the
        noise is terrific; the roaring heard down in the mine is so
        inexpressibly fierce and awful that the boldest men at work are
        afraid to continue their labour; all ascend to the surface to breathe
        the upper air and stand on the firm earth, dreading, though no such
        catastrophe has ever happened yet, that the sea will break in on them
        if they remain in the caverns below.”</span></p><a name="illo_231b"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the great
        sights of the Land’s End is the famous Loggan Stone. After climbing
        up some perilous-looking places you see a solid, irregular mass of
        granite, which is computed to weigh eighty-five tons, resting by its
        centre only on another rock, the latter itself supported by a number
        of others around. <span class="tei tei-q">“You are told,”</span> says
        Wilkie Collins, <span class="tei tei-q">“by the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>guide to turn your back to the uppermost
        stone; to place your shoulders under one particular part of its lower
        edge, which is entirely disconnected all round with the supporting
        rock below, and in this position to push upwards slowly and steadily,
        then to leave off again for an instant, then to push once more, and
        so on, until after a few moments of exertion you feel the whole
        immense mass above you moving as you press against it. You redouble
        your efforts, then turn round and see the massy Loggan Stone set in
        motion by nothing but your own pair of shoulders, slowly rocking
        backwards and forwards with an alternate ascension and declension, at
        the outer edges, of at least three inches. You have treated
        eighty-five tons of granite like a child’s cradle; and like a child’s
        cradle those eighty-five tons have rocked at your will!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the year 1824 a
        lieutenant in the royal navy, commanding a gunboat then cruising off
        that coast, heard that it was generally believed in Cornwall that no
        human power could or should ever overturn the Loggan Stone. Fired
        with an ignoble ambition, he took a number of his crew ashore, and by
        applying levers did succeed in upsetting it from its pivot. His
        little joke was observed by two labourers, who immediately reported
        it to the lord of the manor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All Cornwall was
        in arms, and the indignation was general, from that of philosophers,
        who believed that the Druids had placed it on its balance, to those
        who regarded it as one of the sights of the county, and as a holiday
        resort. The guides who showed it to visitors, and the hotel-keepers,
        were furious. Representations were made to the Admiralty, and the
        unfortunate lieutenant was ordered to replace it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Fortunately the
        great stone had not toppled completely over, or it would have crashed
        down a precipice into the sea, but it had stuck wedged in a crevice
        of the rock below. By means of strong beams, chains, pulleys, and
        capstans, and a hard week’s work for a number of men, it was
        replaced, although it is said never to have regained its former
        balance. The lieutenant was nearly ruined by it, and is said not to
        have completely paid the cost of this reparation at the day of his
        death.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About eleven miles
        from the Land’s End there lies a dark porphyry rock, the highest
        point of which rises seventeen feet above low water. It is called
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The Wolf,”</span> and previous to the
        construction of a sea-tower upon it no rock had been more fatal to
        the mariner. It is beaten by a terrific sea, being exposed to the
        full force of the Atlantic, and it lies just in the track of vessels
        entering or leaving the channel. In 1860 the Trinity House commenced
        the erection of a lighthouse on it, 116 feet high, with a revolving
        dioptric light. <span class="tei tei-q">“The first flash,”</span>
        said a leading journal, <span class="tei tei-q">“from the Wolf
        Lighthouse was shot forth on the 1st of January, 1870, and within the
        last ten years it is difficult to calculate what good it has done, by
        standing like a beneficent monitor in the centre of the greatest
        highway for shipping in the world.”</span> The Wolf light flashes
        alternately red and white at half-minute intervals. A great authority
        on the subject, Sir William Thomson, however, expostulates vigorously
        against all revolving lights, asserting that, for example, the Wolf
        is more difficult <span class="tei tei-q">“to pick up,”</span> in
        nautical parlance, than the fixed beacon of the
        Eddystone.</p><a name="illo_231a" id="illo_231a" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Rev. C. A.
        Johns, writing about 1840,<a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55" href=
        "#note_55"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        that smuggling was still practised <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>till within a few years previously. Most
        families on the coast were more or less engaged in it, and many of
        the houses had, and still have, secret underground chambers, which
        could be entered only through the parlour cupboard, which was
        furnished with a false back. Old grey-headed adventurers talked with
        evident pleasure of the exciting adventures of their younger days,
        and of their frequent hairbreadth escapes. One sturdy veteran in
        particular, who since he had dropped his profession of smuggler had
        on many occasions risked his life in the effort to save the crews of
        shipwrecked vessels, told how he was chased by a king’s boat, how he
        threw himself overboard and swam for dear life, and how he eluded, by
        diving, blow after blow dealt by an oar or cutlass, at last to escape
        safely to land. The rowers who pursued may not have put forth their
        utmost strength, and the blows may have been dealt with purposed
        inaccuracy, for in those days there were many sailors in the navy who
        had been smugglers, and had a fellow-feeling for their kind.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I can myself,”</span> says Mr. Johns,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“recollect having conversed some forty years
        ago with a coastguardsman who had been a smuggler, and who had with
        his comrades been captured by a revenue cutter. He and another were
        tried and convicted, and sentenced, as was then customary, to five
        years’ service in the navy. While on board the vessel in which they
        were to proceed to a foreign station, anchored at Spithead, they
        escaped from confinement, and threw themselves into the sea by night,
        with the intention of swimming ashore. They had not, however, gone
        far when they were descried by the sentinel on board, who gave the
        alarm, and they were fired at. My informant reached the shore in
        safety, hid himself for a short time, and being afraid to return to
        his own neighbourhood, entered into the preventive service, and was
        at the very time I saw him, after the lapse of some years, visiting
        his friends in his native village, and close to the scene of his
        early feats of daring. His comrade was not so fortunate; either he
        was struck by a bullet, or became exhausted before he reached the
        shore, and was drowned. At all events, he was never seen
        again.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">About the same
        period, Mr. Johns tells us, he was, one fine summer evening,
        loitering about the beach, near a small fishing-village, in a remote
        part of the county. It was about four o’clock, the sea was as smooth
        as glass, and the wind so light that whatever vessels and boats were
        in sight were either stationary or sluggishly impelled by oars. One
        fishing-boat only, about a hundred yards from shore, had its sails
        hanging idly from the mast, but yet appeared to be creeping towards a
        quay which ran out between the beach on which he was standing and the
        houses in which the coastguard resided. At the very instant that she
        had advanced so far that the pier was interposed between her hull and
        the houses a great splashing, as of boxes or kegs, or something else,
        rapidly thrown in the water, was heard. Simultaneously a number of
        men ran down the beach into the water up to their waists, and then
        scampered up to their houses, each bearing an armful of something. In
        a few minutes the boat capsized; probably this was done on purpose,
        but as it was in shallow water no harm resulted. Some
        innocent-looking fishermen soon righted her and baled her out. Mr.
        Johns learned later on that no less than 150 kegs of spirits were
        landed on that occasion right under the very noses of the coastguard.
        It was a desperate venture, but the fishermen-smugglers had
        calculated that the officers would not expect any attempt of the kind
        in calm weather, and had reckoned rightly. <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>Smuggling was almost invariably carried on in
        stormy weather, or on dark, cloudy nights. On some occasions the
        people of these fishing-towns and the country behind rose
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">en

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The antiquities of
        Cornwall have called forth a very considerable quantity of learned
        literature, but, with the exception of the picturesque and graphic
        matter furnished by Wilkie Collins, Philip Henry Gosse, and, in
        lesser degree, by the writer just quoted, the county is not popularly
        known. Mr. Collins’s description of Looe, an ancient Cornish
        fishing-town, will be read with interest. He says: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The first point for which we made in the morning was the
        old bridge, and a most picturesque and singular structure we found it
        to be. Its construction dates back as far as the beginning of the
        fifteenth century. It is three hundred and eighty-four feet long, and
        has fourteen arches, no two of which are on the same scale. The stout
        buttresses built between each arch are hollowed at the top into
        curious triangular places of refuge for pedestrians, the
        roughly-paved roadway being just wide enough to allow the passage of
        one cart at a time. On some of these buttresses, towards the middle,
        once stood an oratory, or chapel, dedicated to St. Anne, but no
        traces of it now remain. The old bridge, however, still rises
        sturdily enough on its old foundations; and, whatever the point from
        which its silver-grey stones and quaint arches of all shapes and
        sizes may be beheld, forms no mean adjunct to the charming landscape
        around it.</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg
        213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Looe is known to have existed as a town in the reign of
        Edward I., and it remains to this day one of the prettiest and most
        primitive places in England. The river divides it into East and West
        Looe, and the view from the bridge, looking towards the two little
        colonies of houses thus separated, is in some respects almost unique.
        At each side of you rise high ranges of beautifully-wooded hills;
        here and there a cottage peeps out among the trees, the winding path
        that leads to it being now lost to sight in the thick foliage, now
        visible again as a thin serpentine line of soft grey. Midway on the
        slopes appear the gardens of Looe, built up the acclivity on stone
        terraces one above another, thus displaying the veritable garden
        architecture of the mountains of Palestine, magically transplanted to
        the side of an English hill. Here, in this soft and genial
        atmosphere, the hydrangea is a common flower-bed ornament, the
        fuchsia grows lofty and luxuriant in the poorest cottage garden, the
        myrtle flourishes close to the sea-shore, and the tender tamarisk is
        the wild plant of every farmer’s hedge. Looking down the hills yet,
        you see the town straggling out towards the sea along each bank of
        the river in mazes of little narrow streets; curious old quays
        project over the water at different points; coast-trade vessels are
        being loaded and unloaded, built in one place and repaired in
        another, all within view; while the prospect of hills, harbour, and
        houses thus quaintly combined together is closed at length by the
        English Channel, just visible as a small strip of blue water pent in
        between the ridges of two promontories which stretch out on either
        side to the beach.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Such is Looe as beheld from a distance; and it loses
        none of its attractions when you look at it more closely. There is no
        such thing as a straight street in the place, no martinet of an
        architect has been here, to drill the old stone houses into
        regimental regularity. Sometimes you go down steps into the ground
        floor, sometimes you mount an outside staircase to get to the
        bed-rooms. Never were such places devised for hide-and-seek since
        that exciting nursery game was first invented. No house has fewer
        than two doors leading into two different lanes; some have three,
        opening at once into a court, a street, and a wharf, all situated at
        different points of the compass. The shops, too, have their diverting
        irregularities, as well as the town. Here you might call a man
        Jack-of-all-trades, as the best and truest compliment you could pay
        him—for here one shop combines in itself a smart drug-mongering,
        cheese-mongering, stationery, grocery, and oil and Italian line of
        business; to say nothing of such cosmopolitan commercial miscellanies
        as wrinkled apples, dusty nuts, cracked slate pencils, and fly-blown
        mock jewellery. The moral good which you derive, in the first pane of
        a window, from the contemplation of brief biographies of murdered
        missionaries, and serious tracts against intemperance and tight
        lacing, you lose in the second, before such fleshly temptations as
        ginger-bread, shirt studs, and fascinating white hats for Sunday wear
        at two-and-ninepence a-piece. Let no man rightly say that he has seen
        all that British enterprise can do for the extension of British
        commerce until he has carefully studied the shop-fronts of the
        tradesmen of Looe.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then, when you have at last threaded your way
        successfully through the streets, and have got out on the beach, you
        see a pretty miniature bay formed by the extremity of a green hill on
        the right, and by fine jagged slate rocks on the left. Before this
        seaward quarter of the town is erected a strong bulwark of rough
        stones, to resist the incursion of high tides. Here the idlers of the
        place assemble to lounge and gossip, to look out for <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>any outward-bound ships that are to be
        seen in the Channel, and to criticise the appearance and glorify the
        capabilities of the little fleet of Looe fishing-boats riding snugly
        at anchor before them at the entrance of the bay.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The inhabitants number some fourteen hundred, and are as
        good-humoured and unsophisticated a set of people as you will meet
        with anywhere. The fisheries and the coast trade form their principal
        means of subsistence. The women take a very fair share of the hard
        work out of the men’s hands. You constantly see them carrying coals
        from the vessels to the quay in curious hand-barrows; they laugh,
        scream, and run in each other’s way incessantly; but these little
        irregularities seem to assist rather than impede them in the
        prosecution of their tasks. As to the men, one absorbing interest
        appears to govern them all. The whole day long they are mending
        boats, painting boats, cleaning boats, rowing boats, or, standing
        with their hands in their pockets, looking at boats. The children
        seem to be children in size, and children in nothing else. They
        congregate together in sober little groups, and hold mysterious
        conversation, in a dialect which we cannot understand. If they ever
        tumble down, soil their pinafores, throw stones, or make mud-pies,
        they practise these juvenile vices in a midnight secresy that no
        stranger’s eye can penetrate.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A mile or so out
        at sea rises a green triangularly-shaped eminence, called Looe
        Island. Several years since a ship was wrecked on the island, but not
        only were the crew saved, but several free passengers of the rat
        species, who had got on board, nobody knew how, where, or when, were
        also preserved by their own strenuous exertions, and wisely took up
        permanent quarters for the future on the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">terra
        firma</span></span> of Looe Island. In course of time these rats
        increased and multiplied; and, being confined all round within
        certain limits by the sea, soon became a palpable and tremendous
        nuisance. Destruction was threatened to the agricultural produce of
        all the small patches of cultivated land on the island—it seemed
        doubtful whether any man who ventured there by himself might not
        share the fate of Bishop Hatto, and be devoured by rats. Under these
        circumstances, the people of Looe decided to make one determined and
        united effort to extirpate the whole colony of invaders. Ordinary
        means of destruction had been tried already, and without effect. It
        was said that the rats left for dead on the ground had mysteriously
        revived faster than they could be picked up and skinned or cast into
        the sea. Rats desperately wounded had got away into their holes, and
        become convalescent, and increased and multiplied again more
        productively than ever. The great problem was, not how to kill the
        rats, but how to annihilate them so effectually that the whole
        population might certainly know that the reappearance of even one of
        them was altogether out of the question. This was the problem, and it
        was solved practically and triumphantly in the following manner:—All
        the inhabitants of the town were called to join in a great hunt. The
        rats were caught by every conceivable artifice; and, once taken, were
        instantly and ferociously <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">smothered in onions</span></span>; the corpses
        were then decently laid out on clean china dishes, and straightway
        eaten with vindictive relish by the people of Looe. Never was any
        invention for destroying rats so complete and so successful as this.
        Every man, woman, and child that could eat could swear to the death
        and annihilation of all the rats they had eaten. The local returns of
        dead rats were not made by the bills of mortality, but by the bills
        of fare; it was getting <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg
        215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>rid
        of a nuisance by the unheard-of process of stomaching a nuisance! Day
        after day passed on, and rats disappeared by hundreds, never to
        return. They had resisted the ordinary force of dogs, ferrets, traps,
        sticks, stones, and guns, arrayed against them; but when to these
        engines of assault were added, as auxiliaries, smothering onions,
        scalding stew-pans, hungry mouths, sharp teeth, good digestions, and
        the gastric juice, what could they do but give in? Swift and sure was
        the destruction which now overwhelmed them—everybody who wanted a
        dinner had a strong personal interest in hunting them down to the
        very last. In a short space of time the island was cleared of the
        usurpers. Cheeses remained intact; ricks were uninjured. And this is
        the true story of how the people of Looe got rid of the rats!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many causes, Mr.
        Collins tell us, combined to secure the poor of Cornwall from that
        last worse consequence of poverty to which the poor in most of the
        other divisions of England are more or less exposed. The number of
        inhabitants in the county is stated by the last census at 341,269—the
        number of square miles that they have to live on being 1,327. This
        will be found, on proper computation and comparison, to be
        considerably under the average population of a square mile throughout
        the rest of England. Thus, the supply of men for all purposes does
        not appear to be greater than the demand in Cornwall. The remote
        situation of the county guarantees it against any considerable influx
        of strangers to compete with the natives for work on their own
        ground. Mr. Collins met a farmer there who was so far from being
        besieged in harvest time by claimants for labour on his land, that he
        was obliged to go forth to seek them in a neighbouring town, and was
        doubtful whether he should find men enough left him unemployed at the
        mines and the fisheries to gather in his crops in good time at two
        shillings a day and as much <span class="tei tei-q">“victuals and
        drink”</span> as they cared to have.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another cause
        which has of late years contributed, in some measure, to keep
        Cornwall free from the burthen of a surplus population of working men
        must not be overlooked. Emigration has been more largely resorted to
        in that county than, perhaps, in any other in England. Out of the
        population of the Penzance Union alone nearly five per cent. left
        their native land for Australia or New Zealand in 1849. The potato
        blight is assigned as the chief cause of this, for it has damaged
        seriously the growth of a vegetable from the sale of which in the
        London markets the Cornish agriculturist derived large profits, and
        on which (with their fish) the Cornish poor depended as a staple
        article of food.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is by the mines
        and fisheries that Cornwall is compensated for a soil too barren in
        many parts of the country to be ever cultivated except at such an
        expenditure of capital as no mere farmer can afford. From the
        inexhaustible treasures in the earth, and from the equally
        inexhaustible shoals of pilchards which annually visit the coast, the
        working population of Cornwall derived their regular means of support
        where agriculture would fail them. At the mines the regular rate of
        wages is from forty to fifty shillings a month; but miners have
        opportunities of making more than this. By what is termed working
        <span class="tei tei-q">“on tribute,”</span> that is, agreeing to
        excavate the mineral lodes for a percentage on the value of the metal
        they raise, some of them have been known to make as much as six and
        even ten pounds a month. Even when they are unlucky in their working
        speculations, or perhaps thrown out of employment altogether by the
        shutting up of a mine, they have a fair opportunity of <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>obtaining farm labour, which is paid for
        (out of harvest time) at the rate of nine shillings a week. But this
        is a resource of which they are rarely obliged to take advantage. A
        plot of common ground is included with the cottages that are let to
        them; and the cultivation of this helps to keep them and their
        families in bad times, until they find an opportunity of resuming
        work; when they may perhaps make as much in one month as an
        agricultural labourer can in twelve.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fisheries not
        only employ all the inhabitants of the coast, but in the pilchard
        season many of the farm people work as well. Ten thousand persons,
        men, women, and children, derive their regular support from the
        fisheries, which are so amazingly productive that the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“drift,”</span> or deep-sea fishing, in Mount’s Bay
        alone, is calculated to realise, on the average, £30,000 per
        annum.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the employment
        thus secured for the poor in the mines and fisheries is to be added,
        as an advantage, the cheapness of rent and living in Cornwall. Good
        cottages are let at from fifty or sixty shillings to some few pounds
        a year. Turf for firing grows in abundance on the vast tracts of
        common land overspreading the country. All sorts of vegetables are
        plenteous and cheap, with the exception of potatoes, which have so
        decreased, in consequence of the disease, that the winter stock is
        now imported from France, Belgium, and Holland. The early potatoes,
        however, grown in May and June, are still cultivated in large
        quantities, and realise on exportation a very high price. Corn
        generally sells a little above the average. Fish is always within the
        reach of the poorest people. In a good season a dozen pilchards are
        sold for one penny. Happily for themselves the poor in Cornwall have
        none of the foolish prejudices against fish so obstinately adhered to
        by the lower classes in many other parts of England. Their national
        pride is in their pilchards; they like to talk of them, and
        especially to strangers; and well they may, for they depend for the
        main support of life on the tribute of these little fish, which the
        sea yields annually in almost countless shoals.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Of Cornish hospitality,”</span> says Wilkie Collins,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“we experienced many proofs, one of which may
        be related as an example. Arriving late at a village, we found some
        difficulty in arousing the people of the inn. While we were waiting
        at the door we heard a man, who lived in a cottage near at hand, and
        of whom we had asked our way on the road, inquiring of some female
        member of his family whether she could make up a spare bed. We had
        met this man proceeding in our direction, and had so far outstripped
        him in walking, that we had been waiting outside the inn about a
        quarter of an hour before he got home. When the woman answered this
        question in the negative, he directed her to put clean sheets on his
        own bed, and then came out to tell us that if we failed to obtain
        admission at the public-house, a lodging was ready for us for the
        night under his own roof. We found on inquiry afterwards that he had
        looked out of window after getting home, while we were still
        disturbing the village by a continuous series of assaults on the inn
        door, had recognised us in the moonlight, and had therefore not only
        offered us his bed, but had got out of it himself to do so. When we
        finally succeeded in gaining admittance to the inn, he declined an
        invitation to sup with us, and wishing us a good night’s rest,
        returned to his home. I should mention, at the same time, that
        another bed was offered to us at the vicarage, by the clergyman of
        the parish, and that after this gentleman had himself seen that we
        were properly accommodated by our landlady, he left us, with an
        invitation to breakfast with him the next morning. This is
        hospitality practised in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg

        old man, seventy-two years of age, of whom I asked some questions
        relative to the extraordinary rocks scattered about this part of the
        coast. He immediately opened his whole budget of local anecdotes,
        telling them in a high quavering treble voice, which was barely
        audible above the dash of the breakers beneath, and the fierce
        whistling of the wind among the rocks around us. However, the old
        fellow went on talking incessantly, hobbling along before me, up and
        down steep paths, and along the very brink of a fearful precipice,
        with as much coolness as if his sight was as clear and his step as
        firm as in his youth. When he had shown me all that he could show,
        and had thoroughly exhausted himself with talking, I gave him a
        shilling at parting. He appeared to be perfectly astonished by a
        remuneration which the reader will doubtless consider the reverse of
        excessive, thanked me at the top of his voice, and then led me in a
        great hurry, and with many mysterious nods and gestures, to a hollow
        in the grass, where he had spread on a clean <span class="tei tei-pb"

        consisting of barnacles, bits of rock and ore, and specimens of dried
        sea-weed. Pointing to these, he told me to take anything I liked as a
        present in return for what I had given him. He would not hear of my
        buying anything; he was not, he said, a regular guide, and I had paid
        him more already than such an old man was worth. What I took out of
        his handkerchief I must take as a present only. I saw by his manner
        that he would be really mortified if I contested the matter with him,
        so as a present I received one of his pieces of rock. I had no right
        to deprive him of the pleasure of doing a kind action because there
        happened to be a few more shillings in my pocket than in
        his.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Collins’s
        experiences as a pedestrian are amusing. Says he:—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We enter a small public-house by the road-side to get a
        draught of beer. In the kitchen we behold the landlord and a tall
        man, who is a customer. Both stare as a matter of course; the tall
        man especially, after taking one look at our knapsacks, fixes his
        eyes firmly on us, and sits bolt upright on the bench without saying
        a word—he is evidently prepared for the worst we can do. We get into
        conversation with the landlord, a jovial, talkative fellow, who
        desires greatly to know what we are, if we have no objection. We ask
        him what he thinks we are? <span class="tei tei-q">‘Well,’</span>
        says the landlord, pointing to my friend’s knapsack, which has a
        square ruler strapped to it for architectural drawing, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Well, I think you are both of you <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mappers</span></span>;
        mappers, who come here to make new roads; you may be coming to make a
        railroad, I dare say. We’ve had mappers in the county before this. I
        know a mapper myself. Here’s both your good healths.’</span> We drink
        the landlord’s good health in return, and disclaim the honour of
        being <span class="tei tei-q">‘mappers;’</span> we walk through the
        country, we tell him, for pleasure alone, and take any roads we can
        get, without wanting to make new ones. The landlord would like to
        know, if that is the case, why we carry these loads at our backs?
        Because we want to carry our luggage about with us. Couldn’t we pay
        to ride? Yes, we could. And yet we like walking better? Yes, we do.
        This last answer utterly confounds the tall customer, who has been
        hitherto listening intently to the dialogue. It is evidently too much
        for his credulity; he pays his reckoning, and walks out in a hurry
        without uttering a word. The landlord appears to be convinced, but it
        is only in appearance; he looks at us suspiciously in spite of
        himself. We leave him standing at his door, keeping his eye on us as
        long as we are in sight, still evidently persuaded that we are
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘mappers,’</span> but <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘mappers’</span> of a bad order, whose perseverance is
        fraught with some unknown peril to the security of the Queen’s
        highway.</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“We get on into another district. Here public opinion is
        not flattering. Some of the groups gathered together in the road to
        observe us begin to speculate on our characters before we are quite
        out of hearing. Then this sort of dialogue, spoken in serious,
        subdued tones, just reaches us. Question—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘What can they be?’</span> Answer—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“This is particularly humiliating, because it happens to
        be true. We certainly do trudge, and are therefore properly, though
        rather unceremoniously, called trudgers, or <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘trodgers.’</span> But we sink to a lower depth yet a
        little further on. We are viewed as objects of pity. It is a fine
        evening. We stop and lean against a bank by the road-side to look at
        the sunset. An old woman comes tottering by on high pattens, very
        comfortably and nicely clad. She sees our knapsacks, and instantly
        stops in front of us, and begins to moan lamentably. Not
        understanding at first what this means, we ask respectfully if she
        feels at all ill? <span class="tei tei-q">‘Ah! poor fellows, poor
        fellows!’</span> she sighs in answer, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘obliged to carry all your baggage on your own backs!
        very hard! poor lads! very hard indeed!’</span> and the good old soul
        goes away groaning over our evil plight, and mumbling something which
        sounds very like an assurance that she has no money to give
        us.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“In another part of the county we rise again gloriously
        in worldly consideration. We pass a cottage; a woman looks out after
        us over the low garden wall, and rather hesitatingly calls us back. I
        approach her first, and am thus saluted: <span class="tei tei-q">‘If
        you please, sir, what have you got to sell?’</span> Again, an old man
        meets us on the road, stops, cheerfully taps our knapsacks with his
        stick, and says, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Aha! you’re tradesmen, eh!
        things to sell? I say, have you got any tea?’</span> (pronounced
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tay</span></span>). Further on we approach some
        miners breaking ore. As we pass by we hear one asking amazedly,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘What have they got to sell in those things
        on their backs?’</span> and another answering, in the prompt tones of
        a guesser who is convinced that he guesses right, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Guinea-pigs!’</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It is, unfortunately, impossible to convey to the reader
        any adequate idea by mere description of the extraordinary gravity of
        manner, the looks of surprise, and the tones of conviction which
        accompanied these various popular conjectures as to our calling and
        station in life, and which added immeasurably at the time to their
        comic effect. Curiously enough, whenever they took the form of
        questions, any jesting in returning an answer never seemed either to
        be appreciated or understood by the country people. Serious replies
        fared much the same fate as jokes. Everybody asked whether we could
        pay for riding, and nobody believed we preferred walking, if we
        could. So we soon gave up any idea of affording any information at
        all, and walked through the country comfortably as mappers, trodgers,
        tradesmen, guinea-pig mongers, and poor back-burdened vagabond lads,
        altogether, or one at a time, just as the peasantry
        pleased.”</span></p>

        the most westerly port of England. It has a noble pier, 700 feet

        deed. Out of a population of twelve or thirteen thousand in and about
        the town, at least twenty-five per cent. are hardy men of the

        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Ponthieu</span></span>, went ashore near the
        town, during the prevalence of a strong south-west gale. The Marazion
        rocket apparatus was worked successfully, and the line was thrown
        over the wreck, but the crew, being ignorant of the mode of working
        it, fastened it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg
        220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>loosely on board, instead of hauling it in taut.
        One of the crew managed, however, to get safely ashore by it. The
        Penzance lifeboat was then got out, but on her arrival at the
        ill-fated vessel, the French crew, though in infinite peril, great
        seas washing over them, took no notice, the captain apparently
        forbidding them to leave, or even throw a line to the boat. The wind
        and sea rapidly increased in fury; the vessel was evidently doomed,
        and must soon break up. In vain the life-boatmen entreated. They were
        actually warned off, and had, after earnest warning, to leave. But
        seeing the inevitable loss of life that must ensue, the brave
        coxswain of the boat determined to return. Result: five lives saved.
        The captain still remained obstinate, and at length a coastguardsman,
        all honour to him! volunteered for the perilous duty of going out to
        the wreck by the rocket line, taking with him a letter from the
        French Consul, urging the captain to leave. In the presence of
        hundreds of intensely-excited spectators, the coastguard made his
        way, often under the waves for several seconds, and in peril of being
        washed off. The captain was watching him from the brig, but stood
        motionless, even when his deliverer had arrived under the bows. Just
        then a furious sea broke over the hero of the rocket line, and washed
        him away, and it was feared by all on shore that he must perish.
        Happily, however, he regained the rope, and more dead than alive, was
        washed ashore. Meanwhile the brig was fast breaking up. The masts
        fell over the side. The stern, on which the captain was standing, was
        first battered in, and then clean carried away. It was supposed that
        the captain had perished, but presently he was seen among the
        wreckage, mounting to the foreyard, the sail of which somewhat
        sheltered him. The coastguardsmen fired two more rockets, and one
        line falling close to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg
        221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
        captain, he seized it, but even then seemed irresolute whether to
        save himself or perish with his brig. After a quarter of an hour the
        love of life constrained him to fasten the rope round his body, and
        the foolhardy man was dragged ashore. Within an hour nothing was to
        be seen of the vessel but a few floating spars. The cheers which
        greeted the captain’s rescue were but feeble compared with those that
        had welcomed the return of the coastguardsman whose life had been
        risked in attempting to save him. Brave Gould!</p>

        five young ladies of an equal number of silver medals and
        testimonials inscribed on vellum, the vote of the National Life-boat
        Institution. The four Misses Prideaux Brune and Miss Nora
        O’Shaughnessy had taken a boat through a heavy sea, at the risk of
        their own lives, to save an exhausted sailor from a capsized boat,
        two of the companions of whom had perished before their arrival.
        Samuel Bate, late the assistant coxswain of the Padstow life-boat,
        was towing the ladies’ boat astern of his fishing smack, when seeing
        the accident, they requested to be cast off, and that being done,
        though against his convictions, he states that they rowed
        <span class="tei tei-q">“like tigers”</span> to the rescue through a
        furious sea, and he has no doubt that the man would have perished
        like his companions but for their prompt arrival. Such noble-hearted

        from the Guinea coast, where guinea-pigs came from, he found but one
        solitary house outside of the family mansion of an ancient county
        family. His quick eye noted the admirable harbour and entrance, the
        former capable of holding 500 vessels, and he represented to the
        Council the advantage of making it a port. From that time its
        fortunes grew; soon it became a packet station for the arrival and
        departure of the foreign mails. Now on the lofty headland, St.
        Anthony’s Point, a lighthouse, flashing brilliantly every twenty
        seconds, serves to guide the entering ships and steamships, which
        have sometimes numbered 2,000 in one year. It has a patent slip, dry
        and other docks, and all conveniences for shipping interests.
        Connected with the town is an extensive oyster and trawling fishery,
        and it has a little fleet of pilot cutters. It has a sailors’ Bethel,
        with library and reading-room; and the Royal Cornwall Sailors’ Home
        is a prominent institution. Another of the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“institutions”</span> of Falmouth might be copied to
        advantage elsewhere. Every boatman who rescues a drowning person is
        entitled to receive a reward of one guinea.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Rev. C. A.
        Johns tells us that near Gunwalloe, Cornwall, the land rises, and the
        coast becomes bold for a short distance. The cliffs, though not
        lofty, are precipitous, and offer no chance of escape to any
        unfortunate vessel which may chance to be driven in within reach of
        the rocks. About the year 1785, a vessel laden with wool, and having
        also on board two and a half tons of money, was driven ashore a few
        hundred yards west of the church, and soon went to pieces. Ever
        since, at intervals, after a storm, dollars have been picked up on
        the beach, but never in sufficient numbers to compensate for the time
        wasted in the search. No measures, however, on a large scale for
        recovering the precious cargo were adopted until the year 1845, when
        people were startled to hear that a party of adventurers were going
        to sink a dollar-mine in the sea.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is not the
        only unsuccessful search for treasure which has been made at
        Gunwalloe. In the sand-banks near the church, or, as others say, at
        Kennack Cove, the notorious buccaneer Captain Avery is reported to
        have buried several chests of treasure previous to his leaving
        England on the voyage from which he never returned. So strongly did
        this opinion prevail that Mr. John Knill, collector of the Customs at
        St. Ives, procured, about the year 1770, a grant of treasure trove,
        and expended some money in a fruitless search.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The vessel had
        gone to pieces between two rocks at a short distance from the base of
        the cliff, and here it was proposed to construct a kind of
        coffer-dam, from which the water was to be pumped out, and the
        dollars to be picked up at leisure. Mad though the scheme was,
        operations were actually commenced; a path was cut in the face of the
        cliff, iron rods were fixed into the rocks, and several beams of
        timber laid down, when a breeze set in from the south-west, and in
        the course of a few hours the work of as many weeks was destroyed.
        The wood-work was ripped up as effectually as though it had been a
        mere wicker cage, and the coast was soon lined with the fragments. It
        is not likely the attempt will be renewed. The speculators were in
        this instance strangers, which accounts for the enterprise having
        been taken in hand at all, for any one acquainted with the coast must
        have been well aware that though the sea is tolerably calm sometimes
        for many consecutive days, it is never so for a period long
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223"
        id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>enough to allow the completion
        of a work which requires time, and which, in the most favourable
        weather, is beset with difficulties; indeed, an ordinary breeze
        setting on this shore excites the sea to such a state of fury that
        certainly no unfinished mechanical structure could withstand the
        force of the breakers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The lower classes
        of Cornwall are generally Methodists, and decidedly religious. In
        Scotland also, strict Sabbatarianism is the rule among the poor.
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The
        Northern Ensign</span></span>, in reply to a journalist who had been
        advocating the prosecution of the herring fishery on the Sabbath day,
        had an article showing that there is no class in Scotland, taken as a
        whole, who love, revere, and enjoy the Sabbath more than the men and
        women who live by the sea. At Wick, the largest herring fishery
        station in the world, where the fishers congregate from all parts of
        the coast, at ten o’clock one Sabbath morning not a single fisherman
        was to be seen in the street; in half an hour after knots of men and
        women were wending their way to the various places of worship, and
        when the church bell announced the hour of meeting the streets were
        almost impassable—men, women, and children, all cleanly dressed, and
        not in working clothes, streamed this way and that to church.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No visitor to
        Cornwall ever misses the Lizard, the most southerly headland
        promontory in Britain, a piece of rocky land which has caused more
        vivid and varied emotions than any other on our coasts. The emigrant
        leaving, as he often thinks, and often wrongly thinks, his native
        land for ever; the soldier bound for distant battle-fields, and the
        sailor for far distant foreign ports; the lover just parted from his
        beloved one; the husband from his wife; have each and all strained
        their eyes for a last parting glimpse of an isle they loved so much
        and yet might never see again! And when the lighthouses’ flash could
        no longer be discerned, how sadly did one and all <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“turn into”</span> their berths to think, aye,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“perchance to dream,”</span> of the happy
        past and the doubtful future. How different the emotions of the
        homeward bound, the emigrant with his gathered gold, the bronzed
        veteran who has come out of the fiercest conflict unscathed, and the
        sailor who has safely passed the ordeal of fearful climes; the lover
        ready now for the girl he adores; and the husband jubilant with such
        good news for his faithful spouse. The first glimpse of that
        strangely-named rocky point is the signal for heartiest huzzas and
        congratulation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Lizard Rock
        owes its name, according to various authorities, firstly to its form;
        secondly to the serpent-like colour of its cliffs; and thirdly is
        said to be derived from the Cornish word Liazherd, signifying a
        projecting headland. Its two splendid lights can be seen out at sea

        miles further west, has a fine anchorage, but is more interesting to
        the visitor as containing an isolated pyramidal collection of grand
        rocks, which, with their castle, are the delight of the landscape
        artist. The old castle on the rocky islet rises to a height of 230
        feet. The island is connected with Marazion, a village on the
        mainland, 400 yards distant, by a causeway of stones. In 1846 her
        Majesty Queen Victoria and Prince Albert paid a visit to the spot,
        and the event is commemorated on a tablet let into the wall of the
        pier, and by a brass foot-plate placed on the spot first touched by
        the Royal feet when they conveyed Her Majesty ashore. There is a snug
        little harbour, and the pier just named will allow several hundred
        vessels to unload at the same time. The population of Mount St.

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Plymouth, Devon,
        with its grand breakwater and many associations, has often been
        mentioned in these pages. Comparatively recently it was the scene of
        a most gallant rescue. Five boys were playing on the beach in front
        of the Hoe, when they entered a cave in the rocks, and remained there
        until the tide, which flowed in with unusual rapidity on account of a
        gale outside, completely hemmed them in. Their screams were heard
        from the road and promenade above, and hundreds of people quickly
        congregated. The waves were dashing furiously on the beach, and
        surging into the cave where the terrified lads were crouching,
        shivering with wet and cold, and trembling at their apparently
        inevitable fate. No boat could live in the surf, or dare approach the
        rocks. But seamen’s proverbial ingenuity came to the rescue; ropes
        were procured, and two seafaring men, George Andrews and Thomas Penny
        by name, were lowered over the precipitous crags through the blinding
        spray and dashing foam to the mouth of the rocky recess. Here, still
        attached to the ropes, they allowed themselves to be washed by the
        sea into the cave far enough to seize a boy, when, the signal being
        given, they were hauled out and up. This was repeated, until amid
        enthusiastic cheering, the fifth and last boy was saved.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Has the reader
        ever visited Dartmouth, one of the loveliest spots in Britain? The
        men, and, if history tells us aright, the women too, of that ancient
        town rendered a good account of themselves when the French, in 1404,
        after burning and sacking Plymouth, thought they would have an easy
        prey. The inhabitants of Dartmouth pluckily resisted the invaders,
        and with such success, that the commander of the fleet, three barons,
        and twenty knights, were taken prisoners. But then out of a
        comparatively small population, then as now, a large proportion were

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Southampton, one
        of the most important towns in the South of England, is a place of
        great antiquity, having been in existence prior to the Conquest,
        while many Roman remains are to be found in its neighbourhood. What
        schoolboy is not familiar with the story of King Canute and his
        courtiers, who flattered their royal master that even the winds and
        waves would do his bidding? The Danish monarch was made of too stern
        material to believe such nonsense; and to convince his fawning
        courtiers that he did not possess attributes which belong to the
        Creator alone, he is said to have seated himself by the seaside, and
        in a loud voice commanded the waves to stay. But the fleecy billows
        obeyed him not, and in due course reached the feet of the king and
        his obsequious court. The spot upon which this memorable circumstance
        occurred is still pointed out in the neighbourhood of
        Southampton.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nearly surrounding
        the town remains of the ancient buttresses and towers of the wall
        which once environed it are still to be seen; while on the western
        shore the old Water-gate, from which the merchants embarked, still
        exists. In the old Domesday Book it is described as an important
        burgh. Southampton grew in importance at the time of the Crusades,
        when thousands of troops and crusaders and mailed knights embarked
        thence, or, weather-bound, remained encamped in the place. It soon
        became a great port of call for Flemish and other
        merchant-traders.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Southampton has
        great natural advantages for communication with the sea. The town is
        situated on a swelling point of land, bounded by the confluences of
        the rivers Test and Itchen, and communicating with the Solent and
        English Channel by the fine arm of the sea known as Southampton
        Water, surrounded by charming scenery, and navigable for the largest
        steamers. At its mouth is Calshot Castle, a coastguard station at the
        water’s edge, while half-way between that point and the town are the
        picturesque ruins of Netley Abbey. It has a tidal dock covering
        sixteen acres, and several graving and other docks. Consequently, it
        is the point of departure for the fine vessels of the Peninsular and
        Oriental line, the Royal Mail (West Indies and Central America), the
        North German Lloyds’, Hamburgh, and Havre steamships for New York,
        and the Union Line for African ports, besides an infinity of smaller
        steamships and steamboats for Havre, the Channel Islands, and the
        Isle of Wight. Its inhabitants consider it the Liverpool of the
        South; and even if this is rather an exaggerated view of the case, it
        has undoubtedly grown to be one of the principal ports of the
        kingdom. It ranks fifth in the list.<a id="noteref_56" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now for the
        story of a steamboat which attempted to run away from Southampton on
        her own account. This strange circumstance occurred some few years
        ago, and might well have been attended with disastrous results. The
        steam-tug <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Belmont</span></span> was towing out to sea the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Walton
        Hood</span></span>, a passenger vessel bound for Australia, and after
        taking her down to the Channel, the sails were set on the ship, and
        the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Belmont</span></span> proceeded to cast her off,
        previous to returning to Southampton. In doing so, by some
        unexplained cause the ship collided with the tug, striking her with a
        violent crash, which knocked over her mast and funnel, and threw her
        upon her side. The shock also had the effect of increasing the
        activity of the crew, who, one and all, leaped on board the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Walton
        Hood</span></span>, leaving their steamer in charge of a dog and two
        cats. The steam of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Belmont</span></span> was up, and after a
        succession of plunges and croakings she righted, and cleared the
        ship. Tearing away her bulwarks, she took a sweep round and made a
        bolt for the land. Her fate now appeared inevitable, whilst her
        strange manœuvres made her look like an insane vessel, rushing wildly
        from some pursuer. Her mast and funnel hung over the side, her
        bulwarks were smashed, and the long tiller was dashing wildly to and
        fro; the dog on board was barking, howling, and yelling fiercely,
        rendering the scene both ludicrous and serious. Something evidently
        had to be done to save her. The captain and crew, having recovered
        their composure, obtained a boat from the ship and started in
        pursuit. <span class="tei tei-q">“Pull away, my boys; give it
        her!”</span> was the quick command. <span class="tei tei-q">“Aye,
        aye, sir!”</span> was the ready response, <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>and the tough oars bent to the stalwart efforts
        of the oarsmen. The boat sped onward in the chase, but ere this the
        steam-tug had on her own account altered her coarse, and by some
        cause or other came round, and made again for the point whence she
        had started. Having described a complete circle, she again started
        off on a voyage <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">en zigzag</span></span>, and then made direct
        for Calshot lighthouse. Here the men on the look-out descried her
        position, and having launched and manned their own boat, also started
        in pursuit. The race now became truly exciting, the course of the
        steam-tug being utterly uncertain and irresponsible, according as her
        helm shifted to and fro at the sport of the waters of the Channel. By
        this time, however, she had run some distance, and at length her
        speed gradually diminished, her steam giving out, when her paddles
        stopped from sheer exhaustion. The crew from the lighthouse were the
        first to board her, and her own crew coming up about twenty minutes
        after, she was at length got into working order, and brought safely
        into dock. It appears that the crew had some justification for
        leaving her, the vessel leaking seriously, and being in imminent
        peril of going down.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the morning of
        March 25th, 1878, the country awoke to one of the most painful and
        unlooked-for catastrophes that have befallen the navy during the
        present century—that of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Captain</span></span> hardly excepted, for
        certain doubts had always been felt as to how the bulky ironclad
        would behave in a heavy gale. <span class="tei tei-q">“One of the
        finest corvettes of her class that ever floated,”</span> said a
        competent authority, <span class="tei tei-q">“commanded by a captain
        and officered by men of the highest professional experience, and with
        a crew young, but sufficiently trained, and numerous enough in
        nautical parlance to have <span class="tei tei-q">‘torn her to
        pieces’</span>, capsizes, with the loss of every soul on board her
        but two. Such a calamity, taken in all its bearings and with such a
        loss of life, is unparalleled in the modern history of the navy. It
        is true that about forty years ago a man-of-war schooner (the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Pincher</span></span>), very much over-masted,
        was, off the <span class="tei tei-q">‘Owers,’</span> not very far
        from the same spot, capsized in a heavy squall, and all her hands
        were lost, although she was in company with a corvette at the time.
        But the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Eurydice</span></span> was not over-masted, and
        she went down in broad daylight and in smooth <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>water. Yet where is the officer or the
        man—let him be the best seaman in the world—who can say, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Such would not have been the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Eurydice’s</span></span> fate had I commanded
        her?’</span> The fact is, the disaster, truly lamentable as it is,
        might have happened to any seaman. With a fair wind, smooth water,
        and within a short distance of her anchorage, running along too close
        under the high land of the Isle of Wight to notice the hurricane-like
        squall rushing down upon her in time to prepare for it, the ship was
        literally forced under water, the accumulating weight of which
        eventually capsized her beyond recovery. Adverse comments have been
        made on the ports being open; but with a fair wind, smooth water, and
        Spithead close by, what danger could possibly be apparent, to cause
        them to be closed after a sea-voyage so nearly ended? Had the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The court-martial
        which assembled on the 27th of August, 1878, on board the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Duke of
        Wellington</span></span> flagship, under the presidency of Admiral
        Fanshawe, C.B., Commander-in-Chief at Portsmouth, reported that the
        ship had foundered from pressure of wind upon her sails during a
        sudden and exceptionally dense snowstorm, which overtook her when its
        approach was partially hidden by the proximity of the ship to high
        land. <span class="tei tei-q">“Some of the upper half-ports on the
        main-deck were open at the time, which materially conduced
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229"
        id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>to the catastrophe; but the
        court considers that the upper half-ports having been open was
        justifiable and usual under the state of the wind and weather up to
        the time of the actual occurrence of the storm.”</span> The finding
        of the court-martial mentioned the fact that the captain was
        frequently on deck during the afternoon; and attributed blame to no
        one on board. It considered the ship, which had had ten years’ sea
        service, to have been thoroughly stable. A large number of other
        authorities, however, thought very differently—that she was
        top-heavy, and that she was undoubtedly carrying too much sail.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After exactly
        twenty-three weeks from the day of her foundering the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style=

        of September, safely towed into Portsmouth harbour. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“As an example of perseverance and determination to
        succeed, the recovery of the ship is unique. The elements, which
        throughout the operations may truly be said to have fought against
        the efforts to float her being successful, made a final attempt to
        render those endeavours abortive on the Thursday night and Friday
        morning, with such effect that the Admiralty deemed it inexpedient
        that further attempts should be made, and had even gone to the extent
        of ordering her to be taken to pieces where she lay. Rear-Admiral
        Foley, and those who had so ably and perseveringly worked with him,
        were, however, reluctant to abandon the attempt to recover the ship,
        and he pledged himself that he would undertake to bring her into
        harbour. This pledge was redeemed.”</span><a id="noteref_58" name=

        divers throughout the operations could work only at slack tides and
        in very fine weather, the under-currents on the Isle of Wight coast
        being exceptionally strong.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Eurydice</span></span> lay at first in seven
        fathoms and a half (forty-five feet) of water, and to this must be
        added eight or nine feet of mud into which the wreck was embedded.
        Strong wire ropes were attached to the inner sides of the ports; the
        other ends of the ropes were made fast to the four floating hulls
        placed over and across the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Eurydice</span></span>, and when everything was
        ready and the tide at its lowest ebb, the process of pinning down was
        commenced—that is, the ropes were hauled <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“taut,”</span> and made fast to the lifting vessels, so
        that as the tide gradually rose to its highest point the whole mass
        of lighters with the sunken vessel lifted as well. Then it was that
        the steam-tugs took up their positions, and towed the ill-fated craft
        towards shallower water, till she was left on a bank under the Culver
        cliff, with one side and her upper deck above the water at low tide.
        Even yet the efforts to float her were interfered with. Frequently
        all would be ready for lifting, when the sea would roughen, and
        everything have to be abandoned, the lighters returning to
        Portsmouth. It was raised partially in August, 1878, after four
        months’ continuous labour. After lying for a few days under the
        Culver cliff, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Eurydice</span></span> was again sufficiently
        lifted to clear the bottom, and towed together with the lifting
        vessels to St. Helen’s Sands. When lifted finally, and towed to
        Portsmouth by the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Grinder</span></span>, she had two tugs on her
        port side and one on her starboard, with their steam-pumps working,
        and constantly pumping her hold.</p>

        Brighton—<span class="tei tei-q">“London by the Sea-side”</span> as
        it is often styled—is to many one of the most fascinating of the
        English watering-places. It is both popular and fashionable, the
        resort <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name=
        "Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>alike of the masses and
        of the <span class="tei tei-q">“upper ten.”</span> Its position on
        the sea is charming, while at an easy distance are any number of
        pleasant sea-coast and inland resorts. It has sprung up from a little
        fishing-village to a town of at least 120,000 souls. One feature of
        the place is the solidity and elegance of its public and private
        buildings, while its streets are the best kept in the whole kingdom.
        It extends, with its suburbs Kemp Town and Cliftonville, for
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">four
        miles</span></span> along the coast, and is in great part defended by
        a sea-wall. The celebrated chain-pier is 1,130 feet in length; while
        its Aquarium, already described in the proper place, is the finest in
        the world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The climate of
        Brighton is temperate and mild both summer and winter, in the latter
        season resembling that of Naples; and to these facts is doubtless due
        its great success as a resort for the invalid, debilitated, or
        fagged-out business man. Capital bathing, boating, and yachting, are
        all at the command of the visitor; there are no finer promenades
        anywhere; while riding or driving on the Downs, or to the
        neighbouring rural retreats (among them that most beautiful of
        England’s ancestral homes, Arundel), is a treat open to all whose
        circumstances are moderately easy. In the whirl and din of
        fashionable life there one is apt to forget its practical connection
        with the sea, but it possesses a perfect fleet of mackerel and
        herring boats, and several lifeboats, belonging to the Lifeboat
        Institution, the Humane Society, and the town.</p><a name="illo_255"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the year 1833,
        at New Stoke, near Arundel, the remains of an ancient boat were
        discovered in the bed of what was formerly a creek running into the
        river Arun. It had been constructed of half the trunk of an oak tree,
        hollowed out as the Indians of North-west America do to-day. It was
        thirty-five feet four inches in length, by four feet six inches. In
        1822, a still larger oak boat was found in the bed of the river
        Rother, near Maltham, Kent, which was sixty-three feet by fifteen
        feet, half decked, caulked with moss, and had carried at least one
        mast.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These discoveries
        sink into insignificance with that made in 1880 on the farm of
        Gokstad, not far from Sandefjord, a favourite watering-place of the
        Norwegians. A hill or mound, which tradition pointed out as the
        burial-place of some mighty king or chief, was found to contain the
        entire hull of an old ship of the Viking days. It is of course a very
        venerable relic, being probably more than 1,000 years old. The
        Gokstad vessel, built entirely of oak, is seventy-five feet long
        between stem and stern, and sixteen feet broad amidships; and appears
        to be of a low build, drawing only five feet. The deals were riveted
        together by iron nails; and the ribs, of which there are twenty, are
        connected with the deals at the top by rivets, but at the bottom with
        ties. Amidships, in the bottom of the ship, is a heavy beam, both
        ends of which are fashioned in the shape of a fish’s tail. This beam
        served as a support for the mast, of which there is still a piece
        standing in its place; while the upper part, which had been cut off,
        was found in the vessel. The mast appears to have been about
        twenty-two feet long. Remains of two or three small boats were found;
        some pieces inside the ship, and some pieces close to it. In the fore
        part of the vessel a large copper kettle and water-cask were also
        found, with remains of sails and ropes, and some large oars. She had
        been built for sixteen oars. A hundred wooden shields had been once
        placed in a row under the gunwale of the ship, corresponding to the
        number of the crew, the centre pieces of iron, or bosses, still
        remaining. The arrangement of the shields is the same as that in the
        famous Bayeux tapestry, on which <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>are represented (among other things) the ships
        of William the Conqueror. The old vessel had been used as the last
        resting-place of a great Viking. It was their custom so to bury their
        chiefs. The ship was usually placed with its stem towards the sea, so
        that when Odin, the Jove of the northern mythology, should call the
        gallant chief, he could set sail straight off land for Valhalla, the
        heaven of his hopes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Newhaven, a little
        farther to the east, has a fair tidal harbour and some local
        commerce, but its chief feature is the very rapidly-increasing
        passenger traffic between it and Dieppe, for Paris or London, and the
        traveller who has not tried that route can be recommended to do so.
        The boats, some of them of steel and containing all modern
        improvements, are among the finest in the Channel service, making the
        trip to Dieppe usually in five or five-and-a-half hours. The trip
        through Normandy and the valley of the Seine is varied and
        interesting, and preferable to that from Calais or Boulogne. Near
        Newhaven is the once flourishing town of Seaford, though it is now
        little better than a picturesque fishing-village, in the bay of which
        mackerel are sometimes taken in prodigious quantities, and which
        affords shelter and anchorage for large vessels during the prevalence
        of strong easterly winds.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still farther
        east, and at the extreme southern point of Sussex, stands the bold
        promontory Beachy Head, the scene of many a shipwreck in days gone
        by. It would be a most difficult feat to scale this great chalk
        cliff; and yet the slope of broken <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">débris</span></span>,
        mingled with scanty grass and samphire, steep though it be, does not
        look impracticable, nor indeed is it up to a certain point. The
        writer and his brother once managed to get within a very respectable
        distance of the top, but then the rocky stones commenced rolling
        down, bringing both climbers with them. After many an ineffectual
        attempt to secure a hold by clinging to the samphire, and intervals
        of momentary rest, neither was very sorry to reach the stony beach,
        albeit considerably bruised, battered, and torn. There they found the
        sea had cut off their retreat towards Eastbourne, and before they
        could reach the shore they had to wade through the fast-rising tide
        round one or two projecting corners of the cliff.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the month of
        November, 1821, a dreadful storm visited Beachy Head, during which a
        French vessel was driven ashore and wrecked. All on board were swept
        into the sea, and only four escaped the general destruction, by
        climbing to the top of a heap of rocks which had fallen, at different
        times, from the overhanging cliffs. Their perilous situation can
        easily be conceived; the tide was encroaching upon them step by step,
        and it was certain destruction to attempt to gain the land. The night
        was extremely dark, and the thunder and lightning rendered it still
        more awful. The poor men, finding that they would either be swallowed
        up by the rising tide or dashed to pieces against the rocks,
        determined to deliver themselves up to the mercy of the waves, with
        the forlorn hope of being cast on some place of safety. At this time
        one of the men saw, during some flashes of lightning, a plant growing
        amongst the stones on which they stood, which he knew was samphire,
        and which he also happened to know never grew where it could be
        entirely covered with water. He at once acquainted his
        fellow-sufferers with this fact, and persuaded them to remain where
        they were till morning, being convinced that the height of the tide
        would not be quite equal to that of the place on which they stood.
        The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name=
        "Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>event proved the
        correctness of his information and the value of his knowledge, for

        methodically established against the enterprise of the free-traders,
        we come upon them in every variety of situation. Now they are
        arranged bastion-wise on a commanding eminence, in the suburb of some
        seaport or watering place, in a snug, compact, little square, with a
        tall flagstaff in the centre. Again we stumble on them unexpectedly,
        sheltered in the recess of some <span class="tei tei-q">‘gap’</span>
        or <span class="tei tei-q">‘chine’</span> where a little stream comes
        trickling down to the sands through the deep cleft that time seems to
        have worn <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg
        233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in
        the chalk cliffs. Most frequently they are perched on the crest of
        the line of sand-hills, with a broad look-out in all directions over
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘promontory, cape, and bay.’</span> And often
        they form a conspicuous landmark on some flat stretch of grass-grown
        sand, where the slow-shelving shore is intersected by a labyrinth of
        changing channels, and where mud-banks submerged by the rising tides
        are a perfect paradise for the clamorous sea-fowl. But whatever the
        situation, the general effect is almost invariably the same. They are
        substantial and watertight; suggestive of cheery shelter in bright
        interiors when the wind is howling through the shrouds of the
        flagstaff, driving the sand and gravel in flying scud along the
        beach, and churning and grinding the pebbles in the surf with dull,
        monotonous roar. There are low flat roofs with projecting eaves, and
        small, strongly-secured casements, and the gleam of their spotless
        whitewash catches any sunlight that may be going. In the
        neatly-palisaded little gardens that stretch before the door, a hard
        and not-unsuccessful struggle is always going on with the unfriendly
        elements, while the shell-strewn walks are invariably kept in the
        most perfect order. As you approach them of a warm summer afternoon
        you are conscious of the briny breeze just tainted with a faint
        amphibious smell of tar. It may not be so balmy or romantic as the
        resinous odours that breathe from the pine-woods of Bayonne or
        Arcachon, under the fiercer rays of the sun of Gascony; but it is
        decidedly wholesome, and rather savoury than otherwise. The
        promiscuous use of pitch <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg
        234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and
        tar gratifies the nautical affections of the inmates. Everything is
        paid, caulked, and seamed, from the keels of the white-painted boats
        that are hauled up bottom upwards, to the felt-covered shingles over
        the out-houses, and the frames of the cottage windows, and the
        palings of the enclosure. Everything, even to the concealed
        refuse-heaps, is trim and ship-shape, showing the presence of an easy
        discipline and the predominance of habits of tidiness and
        order.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Review</span></span> goes on to describe the
        exciting and perilous post of the coastguard when import duties were
        excessive, and lucky smugglers made rapid fortunes. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The sympathies of the whole adjacent country were
        against them. Half the country people were employed from time to time
        in running illicit cargoes, and made a very good thing of it. Those
        were the days of hard drinking, and farmers almost openly encouraged
        a trade that dropped kegs of cheap hollands and runlets of pure
        French brandy at their very doors. As for the women, of course—to say
        nothing of their romantic sympathies with daring law-breakers—they
        were all in favour of the men who filled and sweetened the cheering
        tea-cup, that would otherwise have been altogether beyond their
        means. Even gentlemen holding His Majesty’s commission of the peace
        were said to connive at the <span class="tei tei-q">‘fair
        trade’</span> for a consideration, and to express no surprise at the
        production of mysterious casks that had been concealed in
        out-of-the-way corners of their premises. There were certain depôts,
        in dry caverns, in remote homesteads or sequestered barns, the secret
        of which was religiously preserved, although it was the common
        property of highly questionable characters. There were codes of
        signals which could be clearly read by all but the preventive men,
        and which gave notice of danger or of a favourable opportunity, as
        the case might be. The officer in charge of the station had his
        faculties preternaturally sharpened, and could scent something wrong
        in the most natural incidents. The wreaths of smoke rising from a
        heap of burning weeds might convey a warning to some expected vessel.
        A fishing-boat putting out to sea, engaged apparently in its lawful
        business, might really be bound on a similar errand. Then it was the
        business of the day-watch to scan carefully each craft that appeared
        off the coast, and his natural vigilance was stimulated by the
        prize-money that might fall to his share. Then the nocturnal
        promenade was no mere formality. The thicker the night the more
        likely that something might be going on under cover of the fog; and
        the ear of the look-out was always bent to distinguish, amidst the
        murmur of the waves, the sound of suppressed voices, or the plash of
        muffled oars. Nor was the walk by any means free from personal
        danger, and indeed it was seldom taken in solitude; for, even apart
        from the inveterate animosity existing between the smugglers and the
        preventive men, those were days when deeds of violence were common,
        and the life of a man was of little account compared to the safety of
        a cargo that might be worth hundreds or thousands of pounds. If he
        chanced to fall over the cliff by accident, everything might be
        satisfactorily settled before he was replaced; for when a smuggling
        lugger stood in for the coast there were plenty of ready hands to
        help to discharge her cargo; and unless the men of the nearest
        preventive station got assistance from elsewhere, there was little
        left for them but to look on helplessly. Boats from the nearest
        fishing hamlets swarmed in about the smuggler; strings of horses, in
        charge of people armed to the teeth, made their way to the coast from
        the inland farms. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg
        235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>The
        contraband goods, in kegs and bags of convenient size for easy
        landing, were transferred from the ship to the boat, from the boat to
        the beach, from the beach to the pack-saddle, with incredible
        celerity; and when the mounted caravans set themselves in motion,
        those who had assisted at the landing hastened to vanish as they had
        come. On these occasions the smugglers scored a trick in the game,
        and the coastguard had nothing for it but to wait their turn of
        revenge with redoubled vigilance. More frequently, however, they
        succeeded in spoiling sport, for it paid the smuggler amply to run
        one cargo in three. The Government people would keep such a sharp
        look-out that, oftener than not, the friends of the free-traders
        could only help them by signalling danger, and the richly-freighted
        lugger had to put up her helm in despair, perhaps with one of the
        revenue cutters in hot pursuit; or, what was better still, the enemy
        was surprised in the very act of unlading, and a valuable capture was
        effected. Of course a successful exploit of this kind was by no means
        all pleasure and pride. The smugglers with their friends, disguised
        by blackened faces, were sure to show fight if they had any chance.
        As they were busy in the bay, and the unloading was going briskly
        forward, their sentinels would give the signal of alarm, and the long
        galleys of the coastguard would be seen pulling fast inshore, and
        stealing like wolves on their prey from round the nearest headland.
        The attacking force would make free play with its muskets and
        carbines, if it came within reach, and the attacked had to consider
        that their enemies on the water had probably allies on the land in
        the shape of excise officers backed up by soldiers. So the next act
        in the drama was a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sauve qui peut</span></span>, conducted with
        more or less order, and covered with a lavish use of cutlasses and
        firearms. Very possibly the victors had to count the dead, and pick
        up the wounded; and thus the romance and excitement of those days
        were spiced with a very sensible element of danger.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The coast
        north-east from Beachy Head is rugged and interesting till Eastbourne
        is reached, one of the quietest and prettiest of the south-coast
        watering-places, and one which has been very greatly improved of late
        by the lavish expenditure of his Grace the Duke of Devonshire, the
        principal landowner in the neighbourhood. Some of the promenades are
        planted with trees <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">à la boulevard</span></span>. The bathing and
        boating are both excellent; while in the neighbourhood are the ruins
        of Pevensey, an old Norman castle, and Hurstmonceaux, a red-brick
        castle of the mediæval period, ivy-and creeper-covered, and embowered
        in trees. It is the delight of artists, who annually besiege it in
        great numbers. Eastbourne has some hundred fishermen <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>engaged in the herring and mackerel
        fisheries. They have a benefit association or club, into which they
        pay a monthly subscription, and when their nets are damaged or lost a
        part of the money needed to repair or replace them is found. There is
        also a lifeboat, which has done excellent work.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And next in
        sequence comes historical Hastings, which extends for near a mile
        along the sea at the present time, or, if we include the fashionable
        town of St. Leonard’s-on-Sea, its sea front must be reckoned at
        nearly three miles. Many readers will be familiar with the charming
        glen or vale in which it is situated, and which opens to the sea on
        the south. Hastings is otherwise sheltered by high hills and cliffs,
        and has a warm, even, and yet bracing climate; for salubrity it will
        rank with any of the popular sea-side resorts. It has a steady
        population of about 35,000, of whom 700 are fishermen and boatmen. In
        one week the herring catch has been worth £5,000. A boat fitted for
        the herring or mackerel season is worth £350, and for trawling £200.
        The mackerel season commences in April and continues till the latter
        end of July, while the trawling commences and ends two or two and a
        half months later. The herring season commences in September and ends
        in the latter part of November. There is a church at Hastings, under
        the eastern cliffs, for the special accommodation of fishermen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The famous battle
        of Hastings was fought <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">A.D.</span></span> 1066, Oct. 14. The alarm sounded,
        both parties immediately prepared for action; but the English spent
        the night previous to it in riot and jollity, whilst the Normans were
        occupied in the duties of religion. On the morning the Duke called
        together his principal officers, and ordered the signal of battle to
        be given. Then the whole army, moving at once, and singing the hymn
        or song of Roland, advanced in order and with alacrity towards the
        English.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Harold had seized
        the advantage of a rising ground, and, having secured his flanks with
        trenches, resolved to stand upon the defensive, and to avoid an
        engagement with the cavalry, in which he was inferior. The Kentish
        men were placed in the van, a post of honour which they always
        claimed as their due. The Londoners guarded the standard; and the
        King himself, accompanied by his two valiant brothers, Gurth and
        Leofwin, dismounting from his horse, placed himself at the head of
        his infantry, and expressed his resolution to conquer or to die. The
        first attack of the Normans was desperate, but was received with
        equal valour by the English, and the former began to retreat, when
        William hastened to their support with a select band. His presence
        restored the courage of his followers, and the English in their turn
        were obliged to retire. They rallied again, however, assisted by the
        advantage of the ground, and William, in order to gain the victory,
        had recourse to a stratagem, which, had it failed, would have
        resulted in his total ruin. He commanded his troops to allure the
        enemy from their position by the appearance of flight. The English
        followed with precipitation; the Normans faced upon them in the
        plain, and drove them back with considerable slaughter. The artifice
        was a second time repeated, with the same success; yet a great body
        of the English still maintained themselves in firm array, and seemed
        determined to dispute the victory. While they were galled by the
        Norman archers behind, they were attacked by the heavy-armed infantry
        in front; and Harold himself was slain by an arrow as he combated
        with great bravery at the head of his men. The English, discouraged
        by the fall of their prince, fled on all sides. The <span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sadly must all
        readers look back upon the morning of Friday, May the 31st, 1878,
        when the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Grosser Kurfürst</span></span> went down off
        Sandgate, so near to land that the people on shore felt certain that
        the commander would be able to beach her before she had time to sink,
        unhappily an entirely erroneous supposition. Very shortly before this
        ever-to-be-lamented catastrophe occurred, the German squadron, in
        command of Admiral Von Batsch, was sailing with a light easterly wind
        blowing down Channel with all the pomp and pardonable display of a
        force so numerically small yet so grandly powerful. The sea was
        perfectly smooth, the weather fine, and there seemed no more reason
        for anticipating the impending danger than if they had been lying at
        anchor in the sunlit harbour of Bremen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The squadron
        consisted of three vessels, sailing in two columns—the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">König
        Wilhelm</span></span>, carrying the admiral’s flag, and the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Preussen</span></span> forming the port
        division, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Grosser Kurfürst</span></span> forming the
        starboard, and less than two ships’ lengths apart from the admiral;
        indeed, it is said that scarcely one length intervened.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“In this formation the German squadron came across two
        sailing vessels hauled to the wind,”</span> says the writer of the
        article from which we quote, <span class="tei tei-q">“on the port
        tack, and consequently standing right across the bows of both
        divisions. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Grosser Kurfürst</span></span> had first to give
        way, which she did at the proper time and strictly in accordance with
        the rule of the road, porting her helm and passing under the stern of
        the first of these two sailing ships. But the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">König
        Wilhelm</span></span>, which it must be borne in mind was close to
        the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Grosser Kurfürst</span></span> at this time, and
        steering a course parallel to her, endeavoured at first to cross the
        bows of the sailing vessel, but finding she had no room for this
        manœuvre, rapidly changed her plan, and, putting her helm hard
        a-port, also stood under the stern of the sailing vessel. In the
        meanwhile the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Grosser Kurfürst</span></span> had resumed her
        original course, and thus was lying right across the bows of the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">König
        Wilhelm</span></span>, as she came under the stern of the sailing
        barque almost at right angles to the original course.... The captain
        of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Grosser Kurfürst</span></span>, Graf Von Montz,
        seeing the terrible proximity of the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">König
        Wilhelm</span></span>, immediately put his vessel at full speed,
        hoping to cross her bows, but the space would not allow it. He then
        gave the order to port his helm, hoping to lay his ship parallel to
        the course of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">König Wilhelm</span></span>, but unfortunately
        for this also there was neither time nor space.”</span> All might
        have gone well up to this point, however, as it appears the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">König
        Wilhelm</span></span> was in charge of an <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“able and experienced officer;”</span> he had given the
        order to port the helm to steer clear of the sailing vessel, and then
        ordered the helm to be <span class="tei tei-q">“immediately
        steadied,”</span> intending to range up alongside the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Grosser
        Kurfürst</span></span>; but the helmsman had become bewildered, and
        instead of steadying put the helm still more port. The <span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The experience of
        the first lieutenant when the vessel was going down under the very
        eyes of a number of people on shore is interesting in the extreme. He
        felt himself sucked in, and describes a sensation of enormous
        pressure on his ribs, as if the water were forcing him down. Then he
        came across another column of water, which as promptly vomited him up
        to the surface again, when he caught hold of a spar, and saved his
        life. A dreadful fate befell some thirty unfortunate sailors, who, in
        spite of the commands and entreaties of the boatswain, who was
        standing on the forecastle, threw themselves over the bows, and
        endeavoured to swim away. But the sinking ship was too fast for them,
        and they were caught in the netting which is stretched under the
        jibboom, and, thus entangled, were carried down with the ship. The

        means so generally known as many less interesting places on the south
        coast, for the larger number of those who depart for or arrive from
        the Continent usually pass it by. It has been often incidentally
        mentioned in these pages, but no description of its special
        attractions has yet been given.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is situated not
        far from the South Foreland, in the extreme south-east corner of
        Kent, on the narrowest part of the British Channel, and only some
        twenty miles from the opposite coast of France. Hence it is the port
        for steamers crossing to Calais on the Continental service, a trip
        usually made in about one hour and three-quarters. If the reader
        should cross on the now-famous <span class=

        chapter. Dover, though comparatively little used as a watering-place,
        possesses excellent accommodation for visitors—bathing-machines, and
        all the usual paraphernalia of such places. Its grand hotel,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord Warden,”</span> is second to none
        in England, and has sheltered scores of crowned heads and coroneted
        aristocrats, as well as the less distinguished, though perhaps
        equally worthy, Jones, Brown, Smith, and Robinson.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the eastern
        side of the town stands that elevated and noble fortress the Castle,
        of which some description has already been given. A short distance

        bears the name of <span class="tei tei-q">“Queen Elizabeth’s Pocket

        about Dover the views are magnificent. Seaward is the beautiful bay,
        the Straits and the Downs, with its ever-changing fleets, the ships
        of all nations. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg

        seen the lofty white cliffs of the French coast; Cape Grisnez, near
        Calais (which itself lies on low land, and is therefore
        undiscernible), and the heights of Boulogne.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The antiquity of
        Dover is undeniable. Julius Cæsar here made his first descent on
        Britain, in August, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-size: 75%">B.C.</span></span> 55. Picts and Scots, Danes and
        Normans, successively attacked it; while at the period of the
        Conquest, 1066, the town suffered fearfully, the whole place being
        reduced to ashes except twenty-nine houses. But when it became one of
        the Cinque Ports it soon rose in importance, and Dover men largely
        helped that brilliant attack on Philip IV.’s fleet, by which France
        lost 240 vessels. That enraged monarch retaliated on Dover by burning
        the larger part of the town; but before the year 1296 the British
        navy had not merely swept the enemy from the Channel, but had made
        several reprisals on the coast of France. At the period of the
        Armada, Dover, with the other Cinque Ports, fitted out, at a cost of
        £43,000, six large ships for the Queen’s service, which were the
        means of decoying the great <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Galleas</span></span> of Spain on a shoal,
        afterwards engaging and burning her.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Riding or walking
        over the Downs some interesting places may be seen on or near the
        coast. At St. Margaret’s Bay, seven miles north from Dover—to the
        merits of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg

        testify, having both caught and eaten them—there is a pretty little
        fishing-village, with <span class="tei tei-q">“Fisherman’s
        Inn”</span> embowered in trees, at the base of lofty cliffs. Here the
        preliminary borings for the possible Channel Tunnel of the future
        were made. Farther on is Kingsdown, a fishing village and lifeboat
        station, the men and boat of which have done specially good service
        in saving life. Visible from thence is Walmer Castle and quaint old
        Deal, so often mentioned in these pages in connection with lifeboat
        work on the Goodwin Sands, themselves also plainly in sight. Riding
        at anchor in Deal Roads, or outward bound, or on the homeward tack,
        are seen ships, great and little, flying the colours of every
        maritime nation under the sun. The trip from Dover to Deal and back
        can be made by any tolerable pedestrian in a day, allowing time for
        visits to all the points just named. That part of the trip from Dover
        to St. Margaret’s Bay can be made over the Downs only, but thence to
        Deal the coast can be easily followed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Coming nearer
        home, the writer must record a case of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“derring-do,”</span> which will prove—if after what these
        pages have recorded of the men of Deal and Walmer and Kingsdown, of
        Ramsgate and Margate, further proof were needed—that the men of the
        North and South Foreland are not degenerate descendants of their
        forefathers, who sailed and fought and died with Blake and Nelson. It
        occurred in Deal on a Sunday morning in bleak December. A whole gale
        was blowing from the south-west and vessels in the comparatively
        sheltered Downs were riding to both anchors. As the various
        congregations were leaving their respective places of worship
        umbrellas were blown inside out, and children were taken off their
        feet or clung frightened to their parents’ limbs, the wind and spray
        along Deal beach being blinding. Let the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Chaplain”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">nom de plume</span></span> of the excellent
        clergyman who superintends the Missions to Seamen) tell the tale.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Just then,”</span> he writes, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“in answer to the boom of the distant gun, the bell rang
        to man the lifeboat, and the Deal boatmen gallantly answered to the
        summons. A rush was made for the life-belts and for the coxswain’s
        house. The coxswain, Robert Wilds, has for fifteen years held the
        yoke-lines through the surf on the sands, and knows the powers of the
        boat to save. Fourteen men besides the coxswain were the crew, and
        with a mighty rush they launched the good boat down the steep beach
        to the rescue. There were three vessels on the Goodwins. The crew of
        one took to their boats, and not being in the worst part of the sands
        got safe round the North Foreland to Margate. Another schooner,
        supposed to be a Dane, disappeared, and was lost with all hands. The
        third, a German barque, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Leda</span></span>, with a crew of seventeen
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘all told,’</span> was stuck fast in the
        worst part of the sands—viz., the South Spit, on which even on a fine
        day the writer has encountered a dangerous and peculiar boil or
        tumble of seas. The barque’s main and mizen masts by this time were
        gone, and the crew were clinging to the weather bulwarks, while
        sheets of solid water made a clean breach over them—so much so that
        from cold and long exposure the captain was almost exhausted. The
        Deal life-boat, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Van Kook</span></span>, fetched a little to
        windward of the devoted barque, and dropping anchor, veered down on
        her. One cable being too short, another was bent on to it, and closer
        and closer came the lifeboat. If the cable parted and the lifeboat
        struck the ship with full force, not a man would probably have
        survived to tell the tale; or if they got to leeward of the barque
        the crew of the wreck would have been lost, as the lifeboat could not
        again have worked <span class="tei tei-q">‘to weather’</span> to drop
        down as before. No friendly steam-tug was at hand to help the
        lifeboat to windward in case of failure in this their first attempt,
        and both <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg
        243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
        crew in distress and their rescuers were well aware of the stake at
        issue, and that this was the last chance. But the lifeboat crew said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘We’re bound to save them,’</span> and with
        all the coolness of the race, yet <span class="tei tei-q">‘daring all
        that men dare do,’</span> they concentrated their energies on getting
        close enough to the wreck to throw their line, and yet to keep far
        enough off to ensure the boat’s safety. They were now beaten and
        hustled by the tremendous seas breaking into and over them, and no
        other boat could have lived a moment in the cauldron of waters
        seething and raging around them. Notwithstanding the self-emptying
        power of the wondrous boat, the seas broke into her in such quick
        succession that she was and remained full up to her thwarts while
        alongside the vessel, and as each cataract came on board the coxswain
        sang out, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Look out, men!’</span> and they
        grasped the thwarts and held on with both hands, breathless, for dear
        life. One sea hurled the lifeboat against the ship, and stove in her
        fore air-box, so that the safety of all made it necessary to sheer
        off. Another sea prostrated two men under her thwarts. The lifeboat’s
        throw-line was at last got on board the barque, and communication
        being established the crew were drawn on board the lifeboat through
        the raging waves by ones or twos, as the seas permitted. Thus saved
        from the jaws of death, so astonished were the rescued crew at the
        submerged condition of the lifeboat and the awful turmoil of water
        around them that some of them wished to get back to their perishing
        vessel; but the coxswain and crew knew the powers of their gallant
        boat. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Up foresail and cut the cable,’</span>
        and with its goodly freight of thirty-four souls the lifeboat, hurled
        like a feather, sometimes dead before the wind, and next moment
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘taken aback,’</span> plunged into the surf
        for home. One of the rescued crew had twice before been saved by the
        same boat (the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Van Kook</span></span>), and encouraged his
        comrades with a recital of his previous deliverances. Some rum, which
        was brought for the use of the lifeboat crew, was generously given by
        them and all used by the perishing men of the barque. And so at last,
        sodden through and through, exhausted, but gloriously successful,
        they landed the staggering and grateful Germans on the Deal beach,
        where, despite the storm, crowds met them with wondering and thankful
        hearts.”</span></p>

        "tei tei-q">“Forth fortune, and fill the fetters.”</span> The spirit
        of daring adventure which spurred his forefathers to feats of
        reckless foray and ruthless feud has, in a milder age, developed into
        the performance of deeds of valour for the benefit of suffering
        humanity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sad to say,
        occasionally, there is another story to be told. In February, 1880,
        some strapping fishermen refused to make up the complement of the
        Blackpool lifeboat—some of her own men being away fishing off North
        Wales, and others at Fleetwood—and remained leafing on the beach
        while they let the coxswain take in two joiners and a stonemason, and
        then start two short of the complement. Nevertheless four persons
        were saved from the wreck of the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Bessie
        Jones</span></span>, under circumstances most honourable to the
        rescuers. On their return, being obliged to run over the bank with a

        id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>tremendous sea running, they
        had the narrowest escape from being capsized; one man was washed out
        of the boat, but was recovered, and most of the loose tackle was
        swept overboard and irretrievably lost.</p><a name="illo_266" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Popular Ramsgate,
        with its fashionably select annexe St. Lawrence-on-Sea, is so well
        known by all, that no lengthened description is required here, for
        its actual and practical connection with the sea, in the noble work
        done by its lifeboatsmen, has already been detailed. Ramsgate has a
        fine harbour and piers, from which the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“husbands’ boat”</span> is often, more especially on
        Saturdays, watched and longed for by hundreds of wives and
        daughters.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Margate had, in
        Queen Elizabeth’s reign, fifteen boats and other vessels, ranging
        from one to eighteen tons, there being four of the latter. It had 108
        inhabited houses. It now has a floating population of 50,000 to
        70,000 people, the permanent residents being about 15,000 in number.
        There are several pilots, and a large number of luggers employed in
        fishing and in seeking for casualties; it owns a certain number of
        coasting vessels; while a large number of coasters and French
        fishing-boats come in during the winter months and fishing season for
        refuge, repairs, and provisions. Margate has a Seaman’s Room and
        Observatory, and Ramsgate a Seaman’s Infirmary. The local agents

        visited Ramsgate or Margate, has not, some time or other in his or
        her life, nourished an all-absorbing curiosity to peep into the
        interior and solve the mysteries of those distant beacons, the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Floating Light Ships.”</span> Those who have
        seen them either lying peacefully on the tranquil bosom of the sunlit
        ocean, or trembling and shaken in Neptune’s angry moods, still
        valiant and isolated, nobly doing their duty, must often have wished
        to get a closer view. That natural curiosity can be gratified at
        last; the curtain has been raised, so that we may peep into the

        into voluntary imprisonment for one week on the Gulf Stream Light
        Vessel, one of three floating lights which mark the Goodwin
        Sands.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“That curious, almost ridiculous-looking craft,”</span>
        writes Mr. Ballantyne, <span class="tei tei-q">“was among the
        aristocracy of shipping. Its important office stamped it with
        nobility. It lay there, conspicuous in its royal colour, from day to
        day and year to year, to mark the fair-way between Old England and
        the outlying shoals, distinguished in daylight by a huge ball at its
        mast-head, and at night by a magnificent lantern, with argand lamps
        and concave reflectors, which shot rays like lightning far and wide
        over the watery waste, while in thick weather, when neither ball nor
        light could be discerned, a sonorous gong gave its deep-toned warning
        to the approaching mariner, and let him know his position amidst the
        surrounding dangers.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here the writer
        bestows well-deserved praise upon the services, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“disinterested and universal,”</span> of this lonely
        craft, and afterwards tells you what would meet the eye, if, leaning
        against the stern, you gazed along the deck forward.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It was an interesting kingdom in detail. Leaving out of
        view all that which was behind him, and which, of course, he could
        not see, we may remark that just before him stood the binnacle and
        compass, and the cabin skylight. On his right and left the territory
        of the quarter deck was seriously circumscribed and the promenade
        much interfered with by the ship’s boats, which, like their parent,
        were painted red, and which did not hang at the davits, but, like
        young lobsters of the kangaroo type, found shelter within their
        mother when not at sea on their own account. Near to them were two
        signal carronades. Beyond the skylight rose the bright brass funnel
        of the cabin chimney, and the winch by means of which the lantern was
        hoisted. Then came another skylight and the companion hatch about the
        centre of the deck. Just beyond this stood the most important part of
        the vessel—the lantern-house. This was a circular wooden structure
        about six feet in diameter, with a door and small windows.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Inside was the lantern—the beautiful piece of mechanism
        for which the light-ship, its crew and appurtenances, were
        maintained. Right through the centre of this house rose the thick,
        unyielding mast of the vessel. The lantern, which was just a little
        less than its house, surrounded the mast and travelled upon
        it.”</span> Immediately at sundown the order <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Up lights”</span> was given, regular as the sun itself.
        The lantern was connected with the rod and pinion, by means of which
        with the clock-work beneath, the light was made to revolve and
        <span class="tei tei-q">“flash”</span> once every third of a minute.
        The glass of the lantern is frequently broken, not by wind and wave,
        but by the sea-birds, which dash violently against it. In a single
        night, nine panes of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg
        246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a
        light-house were shattered from this cause. On one occasion one
        thousand wild ducks were caught by the crew of a light-ship. It is
        necessary to defend with trellis-work the lights most exposed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cabin of the
        Floating Light was marvellously neat and clean. Everything was put
        away in its proper place, not only as the result of order and
        discipline, but on account of the extreme smallness of the cabin. The
        author of the work from which we quote depicts a scene on board
        during a night of storms when a wreck and unexpected rescue took
        place:—<span class="tei tei-q">“A little before midnight, while I was
        rolling uneasily in my <span class="tei tei-q">‘bunk,’</span>
        contending with sleep and sea-sickness, and moralising on the madness
        of those who choose <span class="tei tei-q">‘the sea’</span> for a
        profession, I was roused—and sickness instantly cured—by the watch on
        deck suddenly shouting down the hatchway to the mate, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘South Sand Head light is firing, sir, and sending up
        rockets.’</span> The mate sprang from his <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘bunk,’</span> and was on the cabin-floor before the
        sentence was well finished. I followed suit, and pulled on coat,
        nether garments, and shoes, as if my life depended on my own speed.
        There was unusual need for clothing, for the night was bitterly cold.
        On gaining the deck, we found the two men on duty actively at
        work—the one loading the lee gun, the other adjusting a rocket to its
        stick. A few hurried questions from the mate elicited all that it was
        needful to know.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The flash of the gun from the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘South Sand Head’</span> light-ship, about six miles off,
        had been distinctly seen a third time, and a third rocket went up,
        indicating that a vessel had struck upon the fatal Goodwin Sands. The
        report of the gun could not be heard, owing to the gale carrying the
        sound to leeward, but the bright line of the rocket was distinctly
        visible. At the same moment the glaring light of a burning tar-barrel
        was observed. It was the signal of the vessel in distress, just on
        the southern tail of the sands.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“By this time the gun was charged, and the rocket in
        position.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“One of the crew dived down the companion-hatch, and in
        another moment returned with a red-hot poker, which the mate had
        thrust into the cabin fire at the first alarm. He applied it in quick
        succession to the gun and rocket. A blinding flash and deafening
        crash were followed by the whiz of the rocket as it sprang with a
        magnificent curve far away into the surrounding darkness.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“This was their answer to the South Sand Head light,
        which, having fired three guns and sent up three rockets to attract
        the attention of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Gull</span></span>, then ceased firing. It was
        also their first note of warning to the look-out on the pier of
        Ramsgate Harbour. Of the three light-ships that guarded the sands,
        the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Gull</span></span> lay nearest to Ramsgate;
        hence, which ever of the other two happened to send up signals, the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Gull</span></span> had to reply, and
        thenceforward to continue repeating them until the attention of the
        Ramsgate look-out should be gained, and a reply given.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The steam tug <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=

        to the rescue, thus showing the great value of steam in such matters.
        Having learnt the direction of the wreck from the mate of the
        light-ship, they proceeded on their course.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The life of the
        crew of every light-ship is pretty much the same on Sunday. At dawn
        the lantern is lowered and cleaned and prepared for the next night’s
        work. At 8 a.m. all hands must be on the alert, the hammocks stowed,
        and breakfast served. At 10.30 the men <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page247">[pg 247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>assemble for prayers, and the captain or mate
        performs divine service. After sunset the men meet again for prayers.
        With the exception of the services, the routine on week days is the
        same as on Sunday. The captain and mate take turn and turn—a month on
        board and a month on shore; the men do duty for two months on board
        for one on shore; and, monotonous as their life may seem to the
        uninitiated, it is doubtful whether there is not a beneficial moral
        activity in existence on a floating light that tends to elevate the
        character of both officers and men.</p>

        the east coast of our island, we come to a series of places
        interesting to the men of the sea, and some of them renowned as
        watering-places. Leaving the mouth of the Thames, we soon arrive at
        Harwich, which is acquiring considerable importance in view of the
        Continental routes with which it is connected. It is situated on high
        land at the mouth of the Stour, and near the confluence of the latter
        with the Orwell, immediately opposite the well-known Landguard Fort.
        The shore is bold, and the views of the German Ocean, with its
        ever-shifting fleets of native and foreign vessels, are grand and
        extensive. It has a breakwater, dockyard, and magnificent harbour, in
        which, it is said, more than 100 vessels of the Royal Navy and
        between 300 and 400 colliers have ridden at one time. There are
        steamers constantly plying to Ipswich, about twelve miles up the
        Orwell—a river famous for the beautiful scenery of its banks. Ipswich
        itself, celebrated as the birthplace of Cardinal Wolsey, is the
        largest market town and port of Suffolk, and possesses
        respectable-sized docks and ship-yards, and any quantity of

        dreary little place near Aldborough, on our way up the coast, would
        not attract the tourist, but it was long the residence of one of
        Suffolk’s heroes. Joseph Chard commenced life as a carpenter, but was
        soon found at Thorpeness, where he lived in a little cottage built by
        himself, and owned an old boat, which cost him originally fifty
        shillings, in which he followed the calling of bumboatman, or
        purveyor of provisions and odds and ends to passing ships, from which
        he frequently conveyed messages to shore. Gradually he saved money,
        and, uniting his old and new trades, built a fine boat, which cost
        him twenty-five pounds. In three or four years more he was rich
        enough to purchase a fast-sailing yawl, which a gang of smugglers
        were obliged to relinquish about that time, and with which Chard won
        the prize at the next Aldborough Regatta from a host of born
        watermen. Not content with these successes, he bought and studied a
        coasting-book and chart, and soon emerged a full-fledged <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pilot for one of the most dangerous
        localities, the Sands of the Swin—a study almost as difficult as
        biquadratic equations. He assisted at various times in saving 109
        lives, no less than eighty of which were rescued in his own boat,
        appropriately named the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Farther north, and
        standing upon the most easterly point in all England, the important
        seaport of Lowestoft is situated. The town is placed on a lofty
        eminence, from which fine sea-views are obtained, and the side of the
        cliff descends gradually in hanging gardens or terraces covered with
        trees and shrubs, below which is a long line of buildings
        appropriated to the curing of fish. It has two harbours, with piers.
        The herring (more especially) and the mackerel fisheries employ from
        1,500 to 2,000 men and boys, while the industries connected with the
        sea commence at twine and rope making and end in ship-building. There
        is a chapel for British and foreign sailors, six almshouses for poor
        master fishermen, and two lifeboats.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yarmouth next
        demands our attention. It derives its name from its situation at the
        mouth of the river Yare, and it is, as all know, both a flourishing
        fishing-town and a watering-place. Its antiquity is great; there are
        records of it anterior to Roman times. In the eleventh century, at
        the time of the Conquest, it was known as <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Moche
        Gærnemouth</span></span>, or Great Yarmouth. In 1004, Sweyn, king of
        Denmark, arrived before it with a powerful fleet, and plundered and
        burnt the town. It soon rose again. In 1132, artisans, implements,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249"
        id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>and looms were brought over
        from the Continent, and spinning was commenced at Worstead, a small
        town which gave to the yarn the name it still bears. The old town of
        Yarmouth was formerly defended by walls of which the ruins still
        remain.</p><a name="illo_274" id="illo_274" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the features
        of Yarmouth are the great broad quays, extending about a
        mile-and-a-quarter, the principal streets running parallel with them.
        There are several substantial bridges across the Yare and Bure
        rivers, one over the latter having been erected on the spot where
        nearly eighty people were suddenly precipitated into the water by the
        fall of the old bridge some thirty-eight years ago. There are several
        small docks and shipyards. Yarmouth Roads afford safe anchorage, and
        are constantly resorted to by vessels in distress, the captains of
        which do not dare to brave the elements outside. Forty thousand sail,
        exclusive of fishing boats, annually pass this part of the coast. The
        Roads are formed by several very dangerous sands, which, in foggy
        weather, or when heavy gales sweep the coasts, occasion many fearful
        shipwrecks. More than 500 vessels have been stranded, wrecked, or
        utterly lost off this coast in the short period of three years; as a
        necessary consequence, the loss of life is also considerable, and the
        number of shipwrecked mariners who are landed at Yarmouth year after
        year is very large. The Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society has an
        important branch there. There is a fine Sailors’ Home, which has
        lodged 600 to 700 poor seamen in a single year. It was established to
        provide a home for the mariners of all nations, when wrecked,
        detained by stress <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg
        250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of
        weather, or paid off, in the latter cases giving them board and
        medical attendance, if required, at the lowest possible charge. It
        possesses a museum, library, and reading-room, and a collection of
        charts and nautical instruments. The two lifeboats of Yarmouth have
        been the means of saving several thousand lives. There is also a
        little church and mission for fishermen and sailors near the beach,
        and a mariners’ chapel.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mackerel
        fisheries of Yarmouth alone employ one thousand men, but the herring
        fishery is the most important source of revenue to the town, the
        produce exceeding one hundred thousand barrels per annum, or
        one-fifth of the entire yield of the kingdom. A large number of
        persons of both sexes are employed on shore in drying and curing the
        fish. The Yarmouth boats with two masts (three during the mackerel
        season) are manned by twelve or thirteen hands. They have the letters
        Y. H. and a number painted on the bows. They are now of about
        sixty-five tons builders’ measurement, many of graceful forms, and
        are fast sailers. A single boat will often take a hundred and twenty
        or thirty thousand fish in one night.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In salting
        herrings the fish are simply gutted and placed in the barrels in
        alternate layers with salt. Having been allowed to remain in that
        condition for some few days the barrel is found to contain a quantity
        of floating liquid, which is poured off; more herrings and layers of
        salt are added. The branding consists of affixing the month and day
        on which they were caught and cured, the name and address of the
        curer, and the presence or absence of the gills and alimentary canal.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Red”</span> herrings are made so by first
        being placed in salt for three or four days, then being hung on spits
        which hold about twenty fish apiece. These spits are plunged several
        times in cold water, and after being sufficiently washed, are then
        removed to the open air and dried. Next they are suspended from the
        roof of the smoking-house, which has wood fires on the floor. Those
        for English use are smoked for ten days or so, but those for
        exportation often remain as long as three weeks before being packed.
        As has been mentioned elsewhere, they are used by the negroes of the
        West Indies as a medicinal corrective to the bad effects of a
        constant vegetable and fruit diet. Bloaters are cured more speedily.
        They are placed for a few hours only in a strong brine, are then
        spitted and well washed in cold water, and are smoked very slightly
        for about eight hours only, when they are ready for packing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now for an
        incident which occurred some years since, and which was indeed a
        <span class="tei tei-q">“struggle for life,”</span> although
        eventually the sufferer was landed at Yarmouth. It is a sad truism
        that danger is never so near to us as when we have least apparent
        cause to fear its presence, and the narrow escape of a seaman, named
        Charles Hayman, from a melancholy death, with his vessel in sight of
        his native soil, is only another of the many exemplifications of this
        stern truth. He belonged to the schooner <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Osprey</span></span>,
        of London, and had just made a successful passage from Lagos, on the
        West Coast of Africa, with a cargo of palm oil. The <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Osprey</span></span>
        was brought up and anchored off the North Foreland, when a tremendous
        sea rose and tore her from her anchors, driving her helpless and
        unmanageable into the North Sea.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those on board at
        once made signals of distress, which were seen by the gallant little
        smack, <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Fear Not</span></span>, truly a most appropriate
        name, and her sturdy crew at once went to the assistance of the
        disabled schooner. The master of the smack offered to take the crew
        of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Osprey</span></span> on board, and the mate of
        the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Osprey</span></span>, believing her past all
        power of saving, gladly accepted the generous offer. The hurricane
        was still raging furiously, and it was with the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>greatest difficulty that a boat could be
        lowered from the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Osprey</span></span>, but pluck and perseverance
        succeeded at last, and the valuables and ship’s papers were, without
        delay, stowed away in the boat. The mate and Charles Hayman were the
        first to embark in the tiny craft, which was attached to the schooner
        by a rope, and the remainder of the crew were about to follow them,
        when a heavier sea than they had had as yet to contend against
        snapped the line and cast the boat adrift.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The waves washed
        over and into the boat, threatening to swamp it at any moment. Hayman
        and the mate failed completely to bale the water out, in spite of
        their incessant endeavours to do so, and Hayman, foreseeing the
        inevitable, stripped himself to the skin, and waited for the moment
        to come when the boat would capsize. He did not have to wait long in
        his nudity and the bitter cold; the boat spun over, and carried both
        men under water; however, they soon rose to the surface, succeeded in
        reaching the boat, which was floating bottom upwards, and clung to it
        with the despairing energy of drowning men. Heavy seas broke over
        them so persistently that scarcely a minute was allowed them for
        respiration, and the mate, a weakly man, with a low harrowing cry
        sank for the last time and for ever. Hayman battled on with the
        courage of a tiger. The smack bore down to him in the teeth of the
        gale. He was saved and succoured when death seemed about to seize
        him, and he was supplied with raiment and stimulants by his noble
        rescuers, and eventually landed at Yarmouth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sea has made,
        and still makes, many encroachments on the Norfolk coasts. Thus at
        the not inconsiderable fishing station of Sherringham several yards
        of cliff have been undermined and washed away in a few years’ time;
        and in 1810 a large inn, placed too near the sea, was thrown in a
        heap of ruins on the beach. The coast onward to Cromer, a now
        fashionable watering-place, protected by a breakwater and sea-wall,
        is extremely dangerous, and between it and Yarmouth there are five
        lights.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But we now
        approach a still more dangerous part of the coast—the eastern shores
        of Yorkshire. Flamborough Head first demands our attention.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Head is the
        termination of the chalky Yorkshire Wolds, and it is surrounded by
        islands of chalk, showing plainly that the sea has cut them off from
        their former connection with the land. The cliffs around Flamborough
        Head are riddled and tunnelled by the sea waves, and there are many
        arches and caverns. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Matron of
        Flamborough”</span> is a fine pyramidal <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“needle,”</span> standing boldly out of the water. Under
        the lighthouse are some remarkable broken cliffs, and then two great
        pillars of chalk called the <span class="tei tei-q">“King and
        Queen”</span> arrest attention. One of the largest and most rugged
        caverns is called <span class="tei tei-q">“Robin Lyth’s Hole,”</span>
        and it can be easily explored from the eastern side. The Head is,
        therefore, specially interesting to the artist, and, for other
        reasons, it is equally so to the naturalist. Crowds of sea birds
        startle the visitor, who is doubtless regarded as an intruder, as
        they flock out from all the crevices of the cliffs filled with their
        eggs, and cover both land and sea in their circling flight. The
        somewhat giddy feat of descending the face of the cliff with the aid
        of ropes, for the sake of the eggs, is one by which the Flamborough
        men gain their living in the summer. <span class="tei tei-q">“A more
        familiar hazard is run by the bold fishers of this coast, who, in
        their little cobles, set forth from the north or the south landing to
        visit, perhaps, the Dogger Bank, possibly to return no more.
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘The sea gat him,’</span> is too often the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a name="Pg252"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Filey, a quiet
        watering-place, is sheltered by the above-named headland, and its
        pretty terraces, squares, shrubs, trees, and flowers, its sands where
        a band plays daily during the season, afford a strong contrast to the
        ofttimes turbulent ocean without. The title of the place is derived
        from the ancient name, <span class="tei tei-q">“The File,”</span>
        given to a rocky tongue of land which shoots out into the sea, and
        serves in every respect as a breakwater to the place. Outside, in
        heavy seas, great pieces of rock may be seen rolling and tumbling
        about, swayed at the will of the waves. This is called Filey
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Brig”</span> (bridge), and the promontory is
        said to have a great resemblance to the mole at Tangiers. Its
        extremity can be reached at low water, and from thence most lovely
        views of Scarborough cliffs and its castle and Flamborough Head are
        obtained. At high water the Brig is overflowed, and the waves often
        cause a white spray against its rocks, which throw it high in the
        air. The effect from the esplanade is, for want of a better simile,
        very much like a concentration of white plumes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One Sunday
        afternoon, but one on which no Sabbath bell could be heard at sea,
        nor on the usual quiet shores of Filey, a sad event occurred. It was
        seven in the evening; the wind had suddenly chopped round from south
        to north, and now there fell, with the noise of an angry sea rushing
        over a sandy desert, a terrific shower of hailstones, and tempestuous
        weather continued through the night. At daybreak the sea ran
        mountains high, and the storm continued with unabated fury. The wind
        blew a hurricane; the sleet came down as dense as a London fog, and
        obscured the sea from the eyes of the anxious inhabitants of Filey,
        and Filey from the eager eyes and listening ears of the
        tempest-tossed sailor. At nine o’clock the sky cleared, and the
        people of Filey beheld a stout brig, in company with three or four
        more vessels, labouring on in the heavy sea under close-reefed
        topsails, and distant scarcely three miles.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">She showed signs
        as if she had been in collision with some other vessel, or was
        terribly battered and storm-riven. After getting about two miles
        south of the buoy, she was seen to heel over on to her beam ends,
        stagger, struggle to right herself, and, as if aware of the entire
        fruitlessness of the attempt, and giving up in despair, to go down
        with an awful suddenness, taking all hands with her—her name unknown,
        her history unrecorded. The only epitaph in <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page253">[pg 253]</span><a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>memory of the brave fellows who had found her
        both their coffin and their sepulchre was that stamped indelibly upon
        the hearts of the loved ones they had left behind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of Scarborough
        there are most ancient records. Its name is Saxon—from Scar, a rock,
        and Burg, a fortified place. A Northern historian records an invasion
        by the Danes in the ninth and tenth centuries in the following
        manner:—<span class="tei tei-q">“Towards the end of the reign of
        Adalbricht, King of Northumberland, an army of Danes under Knut and
        Harold, sons of Gorin, invading England, subdued a great part of this
        province; upon which Adalbricht, meeting the enemy, and fighting a
        battle at Clifland or Cleveland, in the north, routed the Danes with
        great slaughter. But soon after this the Danes, leading their forces
        to Scardaborga, fought and obtained the victory; then marching to
        York, they subdued the inhabitants, and passed some time in
        peace.”</span> The venerable castle dates from the reign of King

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The harbour of
        Scarborough is the only place of refuge on a dangerous coast reaching
        from the Humber to Tynemouth Haven. It possesses lifeboats, mortar
        apparatus for aiding ships, a Seamen’s Hospital, Trinity House, and
        Mariners’ Asylum. The place itself has become a most fashionable
        watering-place. But sometimes here, as at many other seaside resorts,
        the terrible mingles with the gay. Such was particularly the case in
        November, 1861, when events occurred which threw a general gloom over
        both the inhabitants and visitors.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Coupland</span></span>, attempted the harbour
        during a fearful gale, but could not succeed in entering. She drifted
        rapidly amid foaming billows that chased each other like huge mad
        cataracts, until she struck immediately opposite the Spa promenade.
        In the meantime the lifeboat was manned, and sent out to the relief
        of the vessel, now in most imminent danger. The sea broke upon the
        sea-wall with such terrific violence that the massive stones on the
        parapet were dislodged. The rebound of the waves caused such a sea as
        no small craft but the lifeboat could have borne. Arrived at this
        point, she was watched, and her crew spoken to by the people on the
        Spa. The crew of the lifeboat seemed terror-stricken at their awful
        position. Suddenly a fearful lurch of the boat pitched out a veteran
        boatman, the leading man in her, and one of great experience and good
        judgment. He was quickly washed up to the Spa wall, and was saved by
        a life-buoy. Another of the crew was ejected a few minutes after, and
        was saved by the same means, after a fearful struggle. The oars were
        now dashed out of the hands of the lifeboatmen, and they were at once
        rendered powerless. The boat was washed heavily up against the wall,
        and nothing but her great strength and excellent qualities preserved
        her from being at once dashed to pieces. Ropes were thrown from the
        boat to the promenade, and she was drawn through the surf to a
        landing-place at the southern end of the wall. Here a fatal
        occurrence took place. Having touched the ground, the men jumped out
        before the water had receded, and, seeing the danger they were in, a
        rush down the incline was made to assist them. In the momentary
        confusion that ensued another run of the sea came, and nearly all the
        party were thrown from their feet, and were now scrambling to save
        their lives. Many succeeded in getting up, but another wave washed
        off those who were yet below. Two or three times they were carried
        out and back again. Among these were Lord Charles Beauclerk, two of
        the boat’s crew, and five or six others. A large wave was seen to
        lift the lifeboat with fearful force against the wall; and as the
        boat sank down again, it was found that Brewster, one of the crew,
        had been literally crushed to death between it and the stone
        sea-wall. Lord Charles Beauclerk experienced the same horrible fate,
        but was not immediately killed; he was washed to the foot of the
        cliff, when two gentlemen rushed to his assistance. A rope had been
        previously thrown to him, but he was powerless to grasp it. The
        gentlemen just named succeeded in fastening a rope round him, and
        drew him up the incline, the life just ebbing out of him. He was
        conveyed to the Music Hall adjoining (sad irony of fate!), where a
        physician pronounced him dead. Two or three others were seen under
        the boat, when the waves threw her up almost in the air. One of them
        was the son of a Scarborough banker. All these men perished.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Attention was now
        given to the shipwrecked crew, who had been witnesses of all these
        horrors, and they were eventually all hauled off safely by the rocket
        apparatus. In the same gale fourteen poor fishermen of Scarborough
        lost their lives. Twenty were lost at Yarmouth, and there were wrecks
        strewed all over the east coast.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now for a true
        story with a happier ending, very graphically told by a lady visitor
        to Scarborough.<a id="noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href=

        occurred in the mid-winter of 1872. <span class="tei tei-q">“I can’t
        write decently,”</span> wrote she; <span class="tei tei-q">“my hands
        are still trembling from the excitement of the morning, such a
        tremendous <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg
        255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>storm we have had, and a vessel lost in front of
        our windows again. The sea was one heaving, surging mass of foam, and
        the wind blowing hard from the NE. right upon this coast. Our
        sailor-landlord came in from a look-out seaward with the report,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘There’s a fine brig out to the north’ard,
        but there’s an awful heavy sea on; I’m afraid there’s no chance for
        her, the wind is driving her dead on shore, and I’m afraid she’ll be
        on the rocks before long. She’s a Spaniard, I think, by the looks on
        her. God help ’em!’</span> and he took his glass and went out, the
        big tears standing in his eyes, great sturdy fellow as he
        is.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Of course our hearts were in our mouths in a moment, and
        with straining eyes we watched and watched. On she came; how one
        longed for some unseen hand to drive her back from what seemed
        friendly houses, and people, and land, and yet was so fatal! The
        snow, and hail, and rain made the air thick every now and then, and
        when it cleared there was the vessel being driven headlong before the
        wind. Would she get round the Castle rocks? That was awful
        excitement; if she struck there, there was no hope for the crew. An
        hour nearly the suspense lasted; yes, she is past! a slight lull in
        the fierce storm, and in that lull a fishing-smack, for which there
        seemed no chance, had weathered it all, got round the lighthouse
        pier, and was entering the harbour, a thing that, by the side of the
        brig, seemed a mere child’s toy on those big waves, and had been lost
        to sight again and again. The pier was one black mass of people, and
        on the sands thousands had collected, all eyes on the
        brig.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Now off goes the lifeboat—there is still a chance for
        the brig. It’s a beautiful new boat, that was recently launched, and
        already she has saved more lives (the sailors tell us) than the old
        one did all the time she was here. Her crew have confidence in her,
        and <span class="tei tei-q">‘you know, miss, if her crew haven’t
        confidence in her, it’s all no go; they’d better by half go off in a
        coble, they’d liever too,’</span> said an old sailor to me. I felt as
        if every one I loved in the world were in that vessel, thus tossing
        and struggling with the winds and waves, in uncertainty as to her
        fate. The lifeboat is off now, though, to the pier-head, and the
        rocket apparatus is fixed at a part where they think she’s coming on
        shore. She hasn’t enough sail on, the sailors say. Her master seems
        to find this out, for up go two topsails. She veers; now is her
        chance; if her master knows the harbour well, he may yet get her in.
        He doesn’t, evidently; he has gone a little too far to the south’ard,
        and can’t get back! One frightful gust, one awful sea, and her chance
        is over, and she is driving right on to the worst rocks of all,
        where, if she strikes, the men must perish—no lifeboat and no rocket
        apparatus can reach her. The lifeboat is pulling tremendously towards
        her now, and the sea is fearful; again she veers slightly—the moments
        seem hours. How those men pull! they are close to her, when one awful
        sea catches them, and the lifeboat is swamped. It seemed as if I felt
        the waves dashing over me. I gave an awful scream, and hardly dared
        look again; and yet I couldn’t keep my eyes away. She was all right,
        and eagerly I counted her men, we could see so plainly from our
        windows. They were all right, and now she is alongside the brig,
        though once or twice dashed away again. Then comes the taking of the
        men off. This was almost the worst moment of all, to see them one by
        one dropped into the lifeboat. One man is going nearly in; the
        lifeboat is dashed right away, and there he hangs. The sea dashes
        against him, injures his leg, but they get him back into the brig,
        and then into the lifeboat when she can get close again, and now all
        are in but the captain. He hesitates; almost it seems as if he would
        rather go down with his ship; but he passes some papers, or paper
        like books, into <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg
        256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>the
        lifeboat, and then he follows, and the men pull back. The crew of the
        brig are faint and exhausted; they have had three awful days of it,
        but the lifeboat lands them all safely at length at the pier. I felt
        as if I had been up for nights, the excitement had been so great.
        <a name="corr256" id="corr256" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-corr">If</span> she hadn’t
        been a new ship and a good one, she would have been all to pieces
        long ago, the sailors say; but she’s lying almost on her beam ends
        and her deck to windward, with every sea dashing against her, now the
        tide is ebbing.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whitby is the last
        point to be treated here in connection with the dangerous east coast.
        It is an ancient town, dating long before the eleventh century, at
        which latter period it had become a noted fishing-place. At the
        present time it possesses perhaps 500 vessels, large and small,
        exclusive of fishing boats. There are a great number of seamen
        belonging to the place who are engaged in ships on the coast, Baltic,
        and Indian trade, seldom returning home, but for a few weeks in
        winter. That the men must be generally provident is witnessed by the
        fact that there are 800 subscribers to the Mariners’ National Mutual
        Pension and Widows’ Fund, a benefit society under the auspices and
        management of the Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Standing on the
        cliff above Whitby, near the ruins of the old abbey, there is a most
        delightful view seawards. The town is below, mapped out in all its
        varieties of streets, squares, and quays; its terraces mounting one
        above another; its piers projecting into the sea; its lighthouses,
        docks, and shipyards alive with busy artisans; and a capacious
        harbour, divided by a bridge across the Esk, the outer part of which
        has accommodation for 300 sail of ships, while above there is also a
        large basin. <span class="tei tei-q">“All this and much more the eye
        takes in from this elevated stand-point, which, in fine weather, and
        at high tide, is most imposing. The harbour, filled to the brim with
        the blue element, glitters like a polished mirror beneath the rays of
        the sun. The stately vessel, spreading her snowy canvas to the
        breeze, is seen passing from point to point along its winding shores.
        The maze-like coursing of the little yacht, with its slender masts
        and tiny sails, skimming the surface of the water like a swallow on
        the wing, lends animation to the scene. The cry of the sea-bird as it
        wheels in graceful curves, or checks its flight to pounce upon its
        prey in the bright flood beneath, arrests the ear; whilst the loud
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘hurrah’</span> with which the brawny
        shipwright greets the majestic vessel as she glides along the
        well-greased <span class="tei tei-q">‘ways,’</span> and cleaves a
        passage for herself into the flood which is to be her future home,
        re-echoes from the cliffs and shore.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Southward of
        Whitby lies the romantic Bay of Robin Hood, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">alias</span></span>
        Robert Earl of Huntingdon, who lived in Richard I.’s reign. Robin, it
        is said, when about to select a site for a marine residence, resolved
        to take up his abode on the first spot where the next arrow from his
        bow should alight, and this being the place, his name has ever since
        been attached to it. The little town there is one of the most
        irregular and comical-looking places in the world, from the ravages
        of the sea in undermining the cliffs. Built on the ledges of these
        cliffs, at all heights where foothold could be obtained, and perched
        on dizzy crags that overhang the sea, or hid in nooks approached by
        perilous paths, or tottering on the brink of cliffs that vibrate as
        the breakers roll with smothered sobs into the caves that perforate
        their base, there stand isolated houses, terraces and streets, whole
        sides of which have erewhile slipped into the sea below. The town
        itself is in a hole which cannot be seen till close upon it, being so
        entirely locked in by peaks and promontories.</p><span class=

        Ekenhead, of H.M.S. <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=

        to Sestos is about a mile, but the distance swum was four; the

        the whole distance being accomplished by one of the parties in an
        hour and five, and by the other in an hour and ten minutes. The water
        was extremely cold from the melting of the mountain snows. About
        three weeks before, in April, we had made an attempt; but having
        ridden all the way from the Troad the same morning, and the water
        being of an icy chillness, we found it necessary to postpone the
        completion till the frigate anchored below the castles, when we swam
        the straits as just stated, entering a considerable way above the
        European, and landing below the Asiatic fort. Chevalier says that a
        young Jew swam the same distance for his mistress, and Oliver
        mentions it having been done by a Neapolitan; but our consul,
        Tarragona, remembered neither of these circumstances, and tried to
        dissuade us from the attempt. A number of the <span class=

        accomplished a greater distance, and the only thing that surprised me
        was that, as doubts had been entertained of the truth of Leander’s
        story, no traveller had ever endeavoured to ascertain its
        practicability.”</span> Byron’s allusion to the ague caught was

        swimming and feats of natation, the writer is earnest in the hope
        that it may lead to a more general knowledge and practice of the art.
        Were it merely the healthy, manly exercise it is, it would be worthy
        of all encouragement; but there is another and a more important side
        to the question. Annually thousands of valuable lives are lost which
        might be easily saved, not by others, but by their own knowledge.
        Every father of a family should make his children learn at the
        earliest opportunity, and, except in the case of very delicate
        children, they will inevitably take kindly to the exercise. Young men
        should count it as one of their most pleasant and useful recreations.
        Cricket, rowing, riding (if even on a bicycle) are to-day among the
        accomplishments of almost all respectable youths; let all of them add
        swimming to the list. The first three are health-giving and
        invigorating pursuits; the art of natation is all this, and very much
        more besides. Some one or more in every large family to-day travel or
        voyage frequently; usually one, two, or more are settled in the
        colonies or foreign countries, to reach or return from which the wide
        ocean must be crossed. And in spite of steam and all modern
        facilities, wrecks are not unknown to-day. The writer strongly
        advocates the establishment of Government schools of swimming.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every year the
        papers record numerous cases of drowning, but the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">un</span></span>-recorded cases are far more
        numerous. Not long since the National Lifeboat Institution published
        an instructive chart of the numbers lost in one year in <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">inland</span></span>
        waters, rivers, lakes, and ponds. It amounted to scarcely less than
        two thousand persons, a large proportion being young people, all of
        whom ought to have been able to swim. The full annual record of those
        lost at sea and on the coasts would be something appalling.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is no doubt
        that swimming is much easier learned in youth than in middle age, and
        the younger a lad is the easier it is for him to learn. Of all places
        for this purpose none will be found better than a bath. It will
        always be found that where the water is warm it is much easier to
        remain in a long period than where the water is cold. It is for this
        reason <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name=
        "Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>that all our fast
        swimmers come from inland towns. Boys at the sea have probably but a
        few weeks, or at the outside but a few months, in the course of the
        year in which they find it practicable to go into the water. Rough
        days, cold weather, too often deter lads from bathing, though cases
        are indeed occasionally found in which men will bathe in the sea all
        the year round, not only in midsummer, but in mid-winter as well.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In commencing to
        teach a person to swim, the first point is entering the water, and
        here <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ce
        n’est que le premier pas qui coûte</span></span>. Where the learner
        is very young the greatest difficulty often is to induce him to enter
        the water at all. Still, most healthy boys are courageous enough in
        this regard.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Having once persuaded a pupil to walk about within his
        depth, the next great point is to prove to him how great is the
        buoyancy of the water. I think it will be found that, in almost all
        works written on the subject of swimming, the same plan is
        recommended, viz., to place some object at the bottom of the bath
        (such as a large stone or piece of white chalk), and then to tell the
        pupil to pick it up with his hand. He will now experience the
        difficult, not of keeping himself up, but of getting down. The
        buoyancy of the water is so great that, supposing him to be about
        chest-deep, probably he will be unable to pick up the stone at all.
        He will now find from this how very little is necessary to keep a man
        afloat.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another good plan
        is to let some person go into the water with the beginner, and float
        on his back, resting on the learner’s hand. Then tell him to take his
        hand away for a second or two at a time, and, so to speak, balance
        the body on his hand. He will find the pressure of the body barely
        that of a few ounces. In fact, the human body is so nearly the same
        weight as an equal bulk of water that the movement of the arms and
        legs in swimming is not necessary so much to keep the body afloat as
        to keep it afloat in the right position. Many a drowning man has come
        repeatedly to the surface, but often, unfortunately, the mouth or
        nose, through which he could breathe, has not been the portion that
        reached the surface. Another method by which you can give a pupil
        confidence is to go into the water yourself, and prove to him by
        ocular demonstration how very slight a movement of the limbs is
        necessary to keep the body afloat and the mouth above water. All good
        swimmers know how very little movement of the hands or feet will be
        sufficient for this purpose.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In commencing to
        learn, all boys should first learn to swim well on their chests.
        Since the introduction of the side stroke it will be often found that
        lads who have barely learned to swim properly at all try to imitate
        the first-class professionals, and in so doing succeed simply in
        making themselves ridiculous.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The great secret of a good stroke,”</span> says Webb,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“is to kick out the legs wide; and here let
        me observe that it is a popular fallacy to imagine that the speed of
        the swimmer in any way depends upon the resistance of the water
        against the soles of the feet. I have often heard it
        observed—<span class="tei tei-q">‘Oh! that man would make a fine
        swimmer; he has got such large feet.’</span> Now, in the movement of
        the legs the flat of the foot never directly meets the water, except
        in the case known as <span class="tei tei-q">‘treading water.’</span>
        The propelling power in swimming is caused by the legs being suddenly
        brought from a position in which they are placed wide apart into one
        in which they are close together, like the blades of a pair of
        scissors. In fact, the mechanical power here brought into play is
        that of the wedge. For instance, suppose a wedge of ice were suddenly
        pinched hard between the thumb and finger, it is evident that it
        would shoot off <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg
        260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>in
        the direction opposite to that in which the sharp edge points. Now a
        wedge of water is forced backwards, and the resistance caused propels
        the body forward in an opposite direction.”</span> When this point is
        well considered, the importance of drawing the legs well up will at
        once become manifest.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, too, in
        dwelling on the stroke (and by <span class="tei tei-q">“dwelling on
        the stroke”</span> is meant resting for a few seconds in the water
        while the body moves forward), care should be taken that the toes are
        pointed in a direction contrary to that in which the swimmer is
        going. The movement of the arms is never one in which great
        difficulty will be found. The two hands should be kept perfectly
        flat, the palms resting on the water; and at the same time as the
        swimmer strikes out his legs each hand should be brought slowly
        round, one to the right and the other to the left, care being taken
        that the palm of the hand is horizontal. Were the hands to be placed
        sideways, it is at once evident that the water would offer but little
        resistance. By keeping the hands in the position named the resistance
        offered by the water in case of sinking would be very considerable.
        Should the beginner doubt this, let him enter the water and stoop
        down, and keeping his hand flat, bring it suddenly downwards in the
        water; the resistance the water will offer prevents him from doing
        this with any speed at all. On the other hand, should he strike
        downwards with his hands sideways, he will find that he can do it as
        fast almost as he could in the air. Now, in reaching forward with the
        hands the swimmer should always endeavour to reach as far forward as
        possible. Let him imagine some small object is placed in the water
        just out of reach, and let him struggle to reach it; the more he
        reaches forward the faster he will swim. This is a very important
        point.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every boy should
        in learning to swim be very particular as to the kind of stroke he
        acquires with his legs. Bear in mind that if once you get into a bad
        style you will experience ten times the difficulty in altering it
        into a correct one than you would by commencing to learn to swim
        afresh; for this reason every one learning to swim should go and
        watch carefully some first-class swimmer, and note how he moves his
        legs, and then imitate him as closely as possible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Diving from a
        height requires, as Artemus Ward observed when he took the census,
        experience, like any other business; and just as that worthy
        gentleman got into difficulties with the two first old maids he met,
        and whose mouths he attempted to examine, not believing their answers
        to be correct with regard to age, so many a boy who has witnessed the
        apparently easy feat of taking a header has come to terrible grief by
        finding himself come down flat on the water, which he has shortly
        afterwards left with the appearance of having had a particularly
        strong mustard poultice on his chest. Now, in diving from a height
        of, say, six feet, the heels must be thrown well up, the legs should
        be kept straight and well together, and the two hands brought forward
        in front of the head, exactly similar to the position that a man
        takes in making his first attempt at swimming on his chest. The hands
        act simply as a breakwater, and they should be turned up the moment
        the water is reached, thus preventing the diver going deep, and also
        enabling him to dart forward along the surface the moment he reaches
        the water. A good diver can dive from a height of forty to fifty
        feet, and yet never go a yard below the surface.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On one occasion,
        when only fourteen years of age, a boy dived from the top deck of Her
        Majesty’s ship <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">President</span></span>, stationed at the West
        India Docks. The height above water was <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>forty-five feet, and those who witnessed him
        state that they did not think he went more than two feet below the
        surface. Neither man nor boy should attempt to dive from such a
        height. Were they to slip or to fall flat, the probability is that
        they would be killed on the spot. But should it at any time be
        necessary to take a dive from a high place, bear in mind that you
        must not give the same movement to your body as if you were going off
        from the height of a few feet, otherwise you will turn completely
        over in the air and come down on your back, which, should the
        distance be very great, would probably kill you; and if the distance
        be moderate, you would certainly have the appearance of having had a
        severe whipping. In diving, and in everything else, it is practice
        only that will make perfect. Webb dived off the yard-arm of a ship
        quite thirty feet above the water; but if by chance any one from such
        a height comes in the least degree flat, he will hurt himself
        considerably.</p><a name="illo_286" id="illo_286" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many stories have
        been told in this work of native divers, but referring merely to
        their power of remaining under water, and not their diving from a
        height; and, so far as swimming goes, no black people approach a
        first-class English swimmer. Three feet of water are sufficient to
        dive in, but no man in his senses would ever make a dive from any
        height unless the water was at least five or six feet deep, as if by
        chance he should come down a little straighter than he intended, he
        would inevitably dash his brains out, in addition to breaking both
        his arms against the bottom of the bath or river. Great care, too,
        should be taken in diving into any open piece of water. Webb mentions
        a case in which a man was seen to receive a fearful laceration of his
        skull from diving on to a broken green glass bottle which had been
        thrown in.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Innumerable are
        the inventions for assisting the learner of swimming, or for aiding
        those who cannot swim to float. Foremost in the latter category must
        be placed what is known as the Boyton dress, an American invention.
        It is a complete india-rubber suit, and can be inflated at any point
        desired, the result being that the wearer can lie down, remain in a
        perpendicular or slanting direction in the water, his body being kept
        as warm, and if in exertion warmer, than it would be under ordinary
        circumstances. Captain Paul Boyton crossed the Channel in it without
        difficulty, floating, paddling, and even <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sailing</span></span>
        (for a sail is part of the gear), meanwhile feeding from the knapsack
        or receptacle which is a component part of the dress, smoking, and
        drinking cherry brandy amid the boiling waves. <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page262">[pg 262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>This dress would no doubt enable a
        shipwrecked person to live for days, and even weeks, in the water.
        Its expense is not great, but too much for general adoption. It was
        while wearing this dress, in crossing the Straits of Messina on the
        10th of March, 1877, that Captain Boyton met with the adventure
        illustrated in our plate. We translate from an Italian journal the
        following account of it:—</p><a name="illo_288" id="illo_288" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Disregarding the counsels of those who warned him of the
        perils of such a rough sea, and one so infested with dog-fish, Boyton
        let himself into the water at eight in the morning, followed by a
        vessel, which more than once lost sight of him. He rowed in his
        apparatus with the aid of arms which appeared as though made of
        steel, when he suddenly felt himself strongly knocked against behind.
        It was a dog-fish! There was a flash; Boyton raised himself to the
        middle, drew the dagger which he always carried at his side, and
        repelled the assailant. Reassured, he then re-took the oar, drank for
        the third or fourth time some cognac, and about midday, with his eyes
        inflamed by the heavy strokes of the sea, arrived at the port of
        Messina, saluted with enthusiasm by the crowd of people, on shore and
        in boats and steamers, who were anxiously awaiting him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Apparently one of
        the simplest devices for those unable to swim is that known as the
        Nautilus Safety Bathing Dress, the invention of Captain Peacock. It
        is simply a short shirt, made of the purest Irish flax, which fits
        closely round the neck and waist, &amp;c., by means of elastic bands.
        It has an inflating tube and mouthpiece. The principle on which it is
        founded is simply this: Irish flax, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">when wet</span></span>,
        is nearly air and water proof; dipping, then, first the shirt in
        water, air is blown inside by the tube till there is sufficient
        inflation. Should there be any slight leakage, more air can at any
        moment be blown into it by the wearer. These shirts are, of course,
        comparatively inexpensive.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A seaman’s belt,
        invented by Captain Ward, R.N., and sanctioned by the National
        Life-Boat Institution, is highly commended by many authorities. A
        schoolmaster says that he has been accustomed for many years to take
        from thirty to forty boys, of all ages, during the bathing season,
        into deep water, and that not merely is it perfectly safe, and free
        from some objections urged against many swimming-belts, but that its
        use enables young people to swim more rapidly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Captain Warren has
        invented a life-buoy which is highly commended. It consists of a
        bladder chemically prepared, to which is affixed a patent valve, by
        means of which the former can be easily inflated. A second invention
        of Captain Warren’s consists of 500 life-buoys, three feet long, made
        of cork or specially prepared wood, and strung on to a series of iron
        rods, which are connected with the turret or mast of the ship. These
        are all kept together by means of a band, which, when the vessel is
        sinking, would be cut, and the whole of the buoys could be instantly
        released. This apparatus would cost £250, but of course it could be
        made on a smaller scale if required.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A most ingenious
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Life-Buoy Seat”</span> has been invented by
        Mr. Richard Rose, an old traveller and colonist. It is composed of
        two semi-conical buckets of block tin, the smaller end of one
        screwing into the other, together forming a buoy resembling an
        hour-glass in shape. Placed upright it forms a capital deck
        camp-seat, the upper end being of cork, which of course increases its
        buoyancy. In the event of fire on board the two portions can be
        rapidly unscrewed, and each buoy thus representing two buckets,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a name="Pg263"
        id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>a ship with only two or three
        dozen would have an ample supply in such emergency. Practically
        tested in a swimming-bath, several bathers could not sink one placed
        there for the experiment, and it took a dead weight of nearly a
        hundredweight to do so. The buoy being water-tight could, of course,
        be utilised for carrying a supply of water, biscuit, or other food,
        valuable ship’s papers, and so forth, and without materially
        impairing its buoyancy, while several lashed together would form a
        raft. Two ropes are attached to each seat. When one considers the
        confusion and panic that too often attend collisions, fires at sea,
        and shipwrecks generally, this invention would prove of incalculable
        value, as it could be utilised on the immediate spur of the
        moment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Royal Humane
        Society promulgates the following golden rules for bathers (and which
        apply also in part to swimmers), prepared by competent
        authorities:—1. Avoid bathing within two hours after a meal. 2. Avoid
        bathing when exhausted by fatigue. 3. Avoid bathing when the body is
        cooling after perspiration. But—4. Bathe when the body is warm,
        provided no time be lost in getting into the water. 5. Avoid chilling
        the body by sitting naked on the banks or in boats after having been
        in the water. 6. Avoid remaining too long in the water—leave the
        water immediately there is the slightest feeling of chillness. 7.
        Avoid bathing altogether in the open air, if, after having been a
        short time in the water, there is a sense of chilliness with numbness
        of the hands and feet. 8. The vigorous and strong may bathe early in
        the morning on an empty stomach. 9. The young and those that are weak
        had better bathe three hours after a meal—the best time for such is
        from two to three hours after breakfast. 10. Those who are subject to
        attacks of giddiness or faintness, and those who suffer from
        palpitation and other sense of discomfort at the heart, should not
        bathe without first consulting their medical adviser.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now we must
        speak of the greatest swimmer of our day—one who has never been
        excelled. Captain Matthew Webb swam the Channel when he was but
        twenty-six years of age. The son of a country surgeon, he had early
        become fond of the sea, and obtained his first instruction on board
        the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=

        Liverpool.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The event in
        Webb’s life which first brought his name prominently before the
        public in connection with swimming took place on board the Cunard
        steamship <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Russia</span></span>, then on the homeward
        voyage from America. One day a tremendous heavy sea caused the ship
        to roll in a manner which rendered it almost impossible for any one
        to keep their feet without a life-line (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, a
        rope stretched along or across the deck from one point to another),
        and all of a sudden a cry arose, <span class="tei tei-q">“A man
        overboard!”</span> A poor young fellow, Michael Hynes by name, who
        had been ordered aloft in the main rigging to <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“clear the sheet,”</span> had missed his hold, and fell
        backwards into the water. Webb saw him fall, and within two or three
        seconds was after him in the sea, but, alas! could see nothing of
        him, save his cap floating on the waves. On this occasion he was
        thirty-seven minutes in the water before be was picked up by the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Russia’s</span></span> lifeboat, the waves being
        <span class="tei tei-q">“mountains high,”</span> and the ship going
        at fifteen knots. Webb was utterly unable to save the poor fellow,
        who was never seen to rise again, but for his noble attempt
        deservedly received the leading medal, the—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Stanhope gold medal”</span>—of the Royal Humane Society
        of London, another from the Liverpool Humane Society, and £100 from
        the passengers on board the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Russia</span></span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first time
        that Captain Webb took up the idea of swimming the Channel was after
        a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name=
        "Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“good try”</span>—but failure—made by Johnson, to swim
        from Dover to Calais. Webb commenced by an excellent swim from Dover
        as far as the Varne Buoy, about mid-channel. On this occasion he
        remained four and a half hours in the water. His first public swim
        was from Blackwall Pier to Gravesend, a distance of twenty miles—mere
        child’s play to him. After considerable practice he made a trial trip
        from Dover to Ramsgate, remaining in the water nearly nine hours. He
        now publicly announced his intention of attempting to swim to Calais,
        and he received a considerable amount of encouragement as well as
        well-meant advice to make the attempt. A number of extraordinary
        precautions were recommended to him—one, however, being sensible
        enough: that being to cover his body with a coating of some kind of
        grease. On the Ramsgate swim he used cod-liver oil, and, on the first
        Channel attempt, porpoise oil.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second attempt
        of Captain Webb to swim across the Channel took place on August 24th,
        1875, and was crowned with success, after a display of unequalled
        courage and physical endurance. At four minutes to one o’clock on
        that day he dived from the steps at the head of the Admiralty Pier,
        Dover, and at forty-one minutes past ten a.m. next day he touched the
        sands of Calais, having remained in the water, without even touching
        a boat on his way, no less than twenty-one and three-quarter
        hours.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the early
        part of the journey Captain Webb was particularly favoured by the
        weather. The sea was as calm as a mill-pond, and there was not a
        breath of wind. The lugger which accompanied him across the Channel
        had to be propelled a considerable distance by oars. The swimmer was
        accompanied by two small rowing-boats in immediate attendance upon
        himself, one containing his cousin, Mr. Ward, who supplied him
        occasionally with refreshments, and one of the referees, who had been
        appointed at Webb’s own request to see fair play; the other boat was
        used for the purpose of conveying messages to and from the
        lugger.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Everything went on
        favourably till nine p.m., when Captain Webb complained of being
        stung by a jelly-fish, and asked for a little brandy. He had
        previously been supplied with some cod-liver oil and hot coffee. The
        weather still continued perfect, and the intrepid swimmer proceeded
        at a good rate, taking a long, clean breast stroke, which drove him
        well through the water. Owing to the phosphorescent state of the sea,
        he was sometimes almost surrounded with a glow of light. At 10.30 he
        was visited by a steam-tug, which had put off from Dover for the
        purpose, and which, strange to say, left the man who had ploughed
        through the waves for over nine hours without even the encouragement
        of a parting cheer. At 11.45, however, a Dover boat, on its way to
        Calais, gave cheer after cheer to greet him, and one of the small
        boats burnt a red light, which cast a ruddy glow over the scene, and
        illuminated the water all around, the face of Captain Webb being
        lighted up by it, so that he was distinctly seen by all on board the
        Continental mail boat.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At two o’clock
        next morning Cape Grisnez light seemed close at hand, and Captain
        Webb was still bravely struggling on, although at this juncture the
        tide not merely impeded him, but was sweeping him farther and farther
        from the shore. He, however, showed signs of fatigue, and young
        Baker, a well-known diver, sat with a life-line round him by the side
        of the referee, in case of accident, as it was supposed by many that
        the long exposure to cold might cause Webb to become suddenly numbed
        and insensible, and so sink without a moment’s <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>warning. But Webb is a man among ten
        thousand; the collapse from penetrating cold which the best swimmers
        usually experience after long exposure in the water seems unknown to
        him. By nine o’clock he was within a mile of the shore, a little to
        the westward of Calais, and at this juncture, young Baker, then only
        sixteen years of age, plunged in and kept the exhausted swimmer
        company, not, however, trying to aid him in any way except by
        encouragement.</p><a name="illo_292" id="illo_292" class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Unfortunately,
        however, two hours previously a strong breeze had risen, and the sea,
        which had hitherto been like a sheet of glass, was running high, with
        crested waves. Webb was evidently fearfully exhausted. The tide was
        running strongly away from the shore, and the swimmer was battling
        against double odds when he was least fit for it. Still, at 9.45 he
        had lessened the distance by one-half; he was only half a mile from
        the beach. Would he ever reach it?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just as the now
        utterly exhausted swimmer was beginning bitterly to think that
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266"
        id="Pg266" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>failure even at this point was
        possible, a steamboat put off from Calais, and her commander placed
        her in such a position that she acted as a kind of breakwater, for
        the sea was running so high that it nearly swamped the boats
        accompanying him. One last struggling exertion and he touched ground,
        so weak that he could not stand. A couple of men instantly went to
        his assistance, and he was able to walk slowly ashore. When the
        Calais boat left he was comfortably asleep, a medical man watching by
        his side.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I can only say,”</span> says Captain Webb, <span class=

        felt the French soil beneath my feet, is one which I shall never
        forget, were I to live for a hundred years. I was terribly exhausted
        at the time, and during the last two or three hours I began to think
        that, after all, I should fail. On the following day, after I had had
        a good night’s rest, I did not feel very much the worse for what I
        had undergone. I had a peculiar sensation in my limbs, somewhat
        similar to that which is often felt after the first week of the
        cricket season; and it was a week before I could wear a shirt-collar,
        owing to a red raw rim at the back of my neck, caused by being
        obliged to keep my head back for so long a period; for, it must be
        remembered, I was in the water for very nearly twenty-two
        hours.”</span><a id="noteref_67" name="noteref_67" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Webb returned
        to London he met with an enthusiastic reception. In the City he was
        welcomed by the same uproarious heartiness that Tom Sayers less
        deservedly received after his fight with Heenan. The cheering and
        hand-shaking of Webb began at the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Baltic,”</span> increased in warmth at <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Lloyds,”</span> and culminated at the Stock Exchange,
        where <span class="tei tei-q">“bulls”</span> and <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“bears”</span> were eclipsed by the lion of the day, and
        whence he had to beat a retreat to save his right hand from being
        wrung off.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following will
        show the value of ingenuity in the midst of great danger. It occurred
        at a terrible wreck, which took place on the coast, in the sight of
        hundreds of powerless spectators:—<span class="tei tei-q">“In the
        midst of these horrifying moments a man was observed to jump from the
        wreck into the sea. It was concluded by the watchers that he had
        voluntarily destroyed himself to avoid dying by inches and hunger.
        After all, who could blame him? It was a question of only an hour or
        so, for hope there appeared none. But the crowd was agreeably
        disappointed, for the man held his head up in the midst of the
        hissing surges boldly, and although he disappeared every moment, yet
        by the aid of good glasses his head was seen to bob up again, a
        conspicuous black object in the surrounding foam. Expectation stood
        on tip-toe. Would he reach the shore? was asked by a hundred voices
        in an instant, and everybody was anxious to do something to assist a
        man who so nobly tried to assist himself. The minutes that followed
        were intensely exciting; every movement of the swimmer was eagerly
        noticed, and it was with difficulty that several generous spirits
        were prevented from dashing, at all risks, into the sea to his
        assistance. Slowly, but surely, the poor fellow approached the
        shore—his head well up yet. He is just within the outer tier of the
        breakers—poor fellow! he will stand no chance now. See, he is caught
        by a monstrous wave—he rides upon its crest, and is urged rapidly
        towards the beach; the horrid wave curls and breaks; he is rolled
        head over heels; he is gone. No; he rights <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>himself, and he is taken out to sea again by a
        retiring wave. Back he comes again—head over heels he goes once more;
        but this time fortune pitied misfortune, for he was flung by a wave
        within reach of a coast-guard, who, at the risk of his life, rushed
        into the sea and saved him. The secret of his buoyancy soon appeared.
        Under each arm he had lashed (as seamen only know how) an empty wine
        bottle, well corked, and he had stuffed several others under an
        elastic Guernsey shirt, and buttoned his trousers over all, and with
        these frail floats he came through a heavy belt of breakers in
        safety.”</span><a id="noteref_68" name="noteref_68" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before the
        establishment of a floating light off Happisburg, wrecks were very
        numerous on the Cromer coast. One of the greatest philanthropists who
        ever lived, Thomas Fowell Buxton, the great anti-slavery leader,
        spent much of his time at Cromer Hall, and was constantly on the
        shore during bad weather, urging and directing the efforts of others,
        and often <span class="tei tei-q">“giving a hand”</span> himself. In
        the storm of the 31st October, 1823, still vividly remembered on that
        coast, Mr. Buxton performed an act of heroic bravery. About noon, a
        collier, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Duchess of Cumberland</span></span>, ran upon
        the rocks off the Cromer lighthouse. The life-boatmen could not be
        induced to venture out, so terrific was the sea and surf. Once a wave
        ran up the beach and floated the wreck. Buxton sprang into the water,
        hoping that others might be induced to follow, but in vain. Captain
        Manby’s gun was fired several times, but the line fell short of the
        ill-fated brig, on which nine poor sailors were seen lashed to the
        shrouds. At length a huge sea completely broke her up, the water
        being blackened by the bursting coal. The helpless spectators looked
        on, horror-stricken. <span class="tei tei-q">“Poor dear hearts!
        they’re all gone now,”</span> exclaimed an old fisherman; but at that
        instant a body—was it alive or dead?—was seen on the crest of a wave.
        Without waiting for a rope, Mr. Buxton dashed into the surf, caught
        the exhausted sailor, flung himself upon him, and struggled against
        the strong reflux of the surf, until others could reach him. He, with
        his living burden, was dragged to land, both at that moment more dead
        than alive. Buxton said afterwards that he felt the waves play with
        him as he could play with an orange.<a id="noteref_70" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The record of a
        man in humbler life, John Ellerthorpe, foreman of the Humber Dock
        gates, Hull, who deservedly earned for himself the title of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Hero of the Humber”</span> is very
        interesting. During a period of forty years he saved <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=

        whom were difficult cases, as they fell into the Humber through

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His services were
        honourably recognised. Medals and other acknowledgments from the

        guineas from his townsmen, and other valuable testimonials. Turn we
        now to the case of another hero, who saved one life more than
        Ellerthorpe, and until very late in his career received no

        utterly spoiled his good intentions. The boy was drowned. The poor

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class=

        gripped him tight to his breast, and nearly succeeded in drowning

        poor old washerwoman who had overbalanced herself in the water, and
        who when saved wanted to go and pawn her tub that she might reward
        him. Instead of which her rescuer <span class="tei tei-q">“clappit a

        had the pride of an artist, and wanted them to fall in, that he might
        pull them out and show his dexterity. Lambert answered that in those

        a thing as drowning was to be, he would like to be there and save

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“James Lambert worked in Somerville’s Mill. Like most of
        the hands, he must cross the water to get home. For that purpose a
        small ferry-boat was provided: it lay at a little quay near the mill.
        One Andrew had charge of it ashore, and used to shove it off with a
        lever, and receive it on its return. He often let more people go into
        it than Lambert thought safe, and Lambert had remonstrated, and had
        even said, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Ye’ll hae an accident some day
        that ye’ll rue but ance, and that will be a’ your life.’</span>
        Andrew, in reply to him, told him to mind his own
        business.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Well, one evening James Lambert wanted to get away in
        the first boat-load. This was somehow connected with his having
        bought a new hat: perhaps he wished to avoid the crowd of
        workpeople—here I am not very clear. However, he watched the great
        wheel, and the moment it began to waver, previous to stopping, he ran
        for his hat and darted down the stairs. But as he worked in an upper
        storey full a dozen got into the boat before him. He told Andrew to
        put off, but Andrew would not till the boat should be full; and soon
        it was crammed. James Lambert then said it was a shame of him to let
        so many on board. This angered the man, and when the boat was so
        crowded that her gunwale was not far above water, he shoved her
        violently off into the tideway, and said words which, if he had not
        prayed God to forgive them in this world, will perhaps hang heavy
        round his neck in the next.... <span class="tei tei-q">‘ye

        an’ this time, maur slanting towards the quay. That helpit us, and in
        a dozen vi’lent strokes we maybe gained twa yards this time. Then
        doon like leed. Plays the same game again, up, and doon again. And
        noo, sirr, there was something that turned sair against us; but then
        there was something for us, to bollance it. It was against us that
        they had swallowed their pint o’ water by this time, and were nae sae
        buoyant; it was for us that the water was shallower noo, maybe not
        more than twa feet ower head. This wad droon us as weel as twanty;
        but wi’ nae mair nor twa feet water abune us I could spring up fra
        the grun by mere force; for the grun gies ye an awfu’ poower for a
        foot or twa. Sae noo I’m nae suner doon than up again, and still
        creeping for the quay, and the water aye a wee bit shallower. The
        next news is, I get sair spent, and that was bad; but to bollance
        that, some folk on the quay gat rapes and boat-hooks, and pickit off
        ane or twa that was the nearest; and now ilka time I cam’ up, they
        pickit ane off, and that lightened my burden; and bymby I drave a
        couple into shallow water mysel’, wi’ my feet. When I was in seven

        sirr, I saved just ane mair, and then I plunged in and sairched, but
        there was nae mair to be seen noo: three puir lasses were drooned,
        but I didna ken that at the time. And noo I’ll tell ye a farce. I’m
        seized wi’ a faintness, and maks for the shore. But I gat weaker, and
        dazed-like, and the lights o’ Glasgee begins to flecker afore my een:

        to drift to the hinder part of the quay. I hadna the power to draw
        mysel’ oot. I just grippit the quay and sobbit. The folk were a’ busy
        wi’ them I had saved; nane o’ them noticed me, and I would ha’ been
        drooned that nicht: but wha d’ye think saved me, that had saved sae
        many?—an auld decrepit man: haw! haw! haw! He had a hookit stick, and
        gied me the handle, and towed me along the quay into shallow water,
        and I gat oot, wi’ his help, and swooned deed away. I’m tauld I lay

        history of this excellent association, which has now an income of
        nearly £29,000, is interesting. <span class="tei tei-q">“A worthy,
        philanthropic medical man, Mr. John Rye, of Bath, had a servant who
        had formerly been a sailor, and was in the habit of reading the
        newspapers to his master. One morning their attention was arrested by
        an account of some fearful wrecks of fishing boats, with loss of
        life, on the north coast of Devon. The servant asked his master if
        there was any fund out of which help could be obtained to relieve the
        families of those men. The master replied that he supposed there was,
        but he would make inquiries from Admiral Sir Jahleen Brenton, then
        Governor of Greenwich Hospital; and from him he found that there was
        none. They then together drew up a prospectus, and presented it to
        the late Admiral of the Fleet, Sir George Cockburn, who most heartily
        took the matter up, and after circulating the appeal widely, called a
        public meeting in February, 1839, at which Sir George was appointed
        President, and a number of noblemen and gentlemen formed themselves
        into a committee, of which the worthy Chairman, Captain the Hon.
        Francis Maude, R.N., is now the sole survivor. The following month
        Her Majesty the Queen graciously consented to be the Patron of the
        Society; and so prosperous was the infant <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>institution, that at the second anniversary, at
        which the late Sir Robert Peel consented to preside, the sum of
        £1,100 was collected. The Committee next set about to obtain the
        services of gentlemen to act as honorary agents, of whom there are
        now upwards of 1,000; and whose duties are to board, lodge, clothe,
        and forward to their homes all shipwrecked persons. The Committee
        meet every Friday in London to relieve the widows and orphans of the
        lost, not only at the time of their death, but by small annual
        payments. There were thus 9,601 persons relieved in
        1879.”</span><a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sooth to say, and
        in strict justice, we must not forget how much has been done for the
        seaman on the banks of old Father Thames, both by Government and
        private liberality. An excellent home, the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Royal Alfred Aged Merchant Seamen’s Institution”</span>
        exists at Belvedere, in Kent, started under the auspices of the
        Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society. This institution was inaugurated, with
        room for the reception of 400 persons of all grades of the mercantile
        marine, although nothing like that number has been as yet
        accommodated at any one time. The Society also grants out-pensions to
        those who have homes or friends.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most singular
        and characteristic and yet appropriate features of the building are a
        number of little cabins comfortably fitted, and so much like the real
        thing, that it requires only a very slight stretch of the imagination
        for Jack ashore to indulge in the fond delusion that he is at sea
        again. The large rooms are divided into wards, one for masters and
        mates, containing ten cabins, each six feet by seven feet, and
        perfect ventilation is secured by the partitions being open at the
        top. Each man, by this excellent arrangement, has his little cabin to
        himself, and all the sweetness of retirement should he be that way
        inclined. What a contrast is this to the ungainly, unhomely, and
        barren shelters of our Unions!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It speaks well for
        the profession that most of the inmates have seen over forty or fifty
        years of service, which, judging from what we know of service in the
        maritime navy, might decidedly be called active. On being
        interrogated by a visitor, some of these veterans proved having most
        successfully braved the dangers of the deep.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“How often have you been wrecked?”</span> inquired the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second, on
        being questioned, answered, simply, <span class="tei tei-q">“Once in
        1825, sir—going to Hamburg that was; and once in 1828, on the coast
        of Norway; and again on the coast of Java in ’42.”</span> This man
        had also done some memorable deeds on shore, which fully made up for
        his being short by <span class="tei tei-q">“two”</span> wrecks of the
        other.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Greenwich Hospital
        next demands our attention, as once the great home and asylum for the
        seamen of the navy, although now a hospital only. It was founded in
        the year 1694, in memory of Queen Mary, who had long designed the
        foundation of such an institution. It was also built as a monument of
        the great victory of La Hogue. Sir Christopher Wren furnished the
        designs and plans for the edifice gratuitously—a noble gift from a
        professional architect, and valuable to boot. The object of the
        foundation was <span class="tei tei-q">“to encourage the seamen of
        this <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name=
        "Pg275" id="Pg275" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>kingdom to continue the
        industry and skilfulness of their employments, by which they had for
        a long time distinguished themselves throughout the world;”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“to encourage them to continue also their
        ancient reputation for the courage and constancy manifested in
        engagements for the defence and honour of their native
        country;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“to invite greater numbers
        of his Majesty’s subjects to betake themselves to the sea;”</span>
        and so forth. In sooth, the condition of the Greenwich pensioner was
        not, for a long period, particularly enviable. On admission he was
        required to relinquish any pension he might have gained in the
        service. Maimed men received only <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">tenpence</span></span>
        a day, and a shilling a week, intended for tobacco and the humbler
        comforts of life. The Commissioners at one time stated that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the wives are wholly ignored, and their
        circumstances are deplorable.”</span> From the Hospital they received
        only the broken meat of the hall and the rations of men on leave of
        absence. The wives were often reduced to the parish. No wonder the
        poor old veteran used to be so glad for a sixpence or even a
        <span class="tei tei-q">“screw”</span> of tobacco in return for his
        tough yarns!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The system has
        been entirely changed. At present all are out-pensioners, and when in
        good health can follow other employments. On the 26th September,
        1865, the Greenwich exodus commenced. On that day nearly 200 out of
        the 900 pensioners of Greenwich Hospital who had accepted the
        Admiralty offer of pension allowance, in conformity with an Act
        passed in the previous session of Parliament, left that establishment
        for the various parts of the country they had selected for their
        future home. Since that time the whole have left; and the institution
        which, only a few years ago, had upwards of 2,000 inmates, now
        contains only a few hundred sick and disabled. Greenwich Hospital is
        a changed institution, and the system of rewarding those who have
        spent their lives in the service of their country is made more
        consistent with humanity, morality, and common sense. Instead of
        hundreds of elderly but still hale and athletic veterans wandering
        listlessly about the terraces and colonnades of Greenwich, and, if
        the truth must be told, sometimes overstepping the bounds of sobriety
        in the numerous public-houses of the neighbourhood, there are but a
        limited number of indoor-pensioners, and those are such as may be
        fittingly provided for in a place bearing the name of a hospital.
        They are disabled seamen in the strict sense of the term—poor
        worn-out old fellows who require to be taken care of, and who have,
        perhaps, no one but the nation to take care of them. The blind, the
        doting, the crippled, find comfortable board and lodging, and,
        without doubt, attentive nursing in the national hospital. But, as
        there are constantly new applications for admission, it is probable
        that there will always be a few hundreds in the establishment. On the
        first and third Thursday in each month a board sits at Somerset House
        to consider the claims of applicants for admission, and those who are
        passed are sent in an omnibus to the hospital. But for the large body
        of men who, though too old to reef top-sails and to work guns, are
        not too old to do something for their own living, and to wish for
        liberty and domestic life, there is the allowance before mentioned
        from the funds of the hospital, and the power of living where and how
        they please.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        "tei tei-q">“we have no means of knowing, but if some of the men have
        a larger sum than £36 10s., so also many of them will have much less,
        and will be unable to command in their homes the standard of living
        with which the Hospital supplied them. They elect to go, we take it,
        partly because they know the government of the place is to be
        changed, that it is to become a <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        that there will be less freedom of ingress and egress for them
        henceforth; but this is only part of a more general feeling in favour
        of liberty among them, at which nobody who has inquired into their
        condition can wonder. The authorities at Greenwich Hospital have
        contrived to make a palace as dull as a prison. The men have had no
        amusements but a library inconveniently furnished. They have not been
        allowed to have flower-pots in their windows, nor to receive friends
        and visitors in private; and it is not many years ago since they were
        forbidden to walk on the terraces. Some of the punishments, too—such
        as being compelled to wear a yellow collar and do scavengers’
        work—have been harsh and injudicious. All these things have combined
        with the monastic character of the place to give a character of
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ennui</span></span> and listlessness to the
        Greenwich pensioner’s life, which must have struck every observing
        visitor. Dulness has been relieved within the walls chiefly by
        temptation without.</span></p><a name="illo_303" id="illo_303" class=

        Greenwich as a place of pious repose, where the sailor might end his
        days in the fear of God, it has become the favourite haunt of the
        pleasure-loving cockney—an emporium of shrimps, a reservoir of beer.
        Those quaint figures—the <span class="tei tei-q">‘geese’</span> and
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘blue-bottles’</span> of local slang—lounging
        about under the trees of the park, and loitering through the streets

        from the metropolis as parts of the amusements of the place. They
        have been paid for yarns in drink and stray shillings, and have found
        the doctrine that sailors lived only for grog and tobacco accepted by
        their admirers as one of the glories of the British navy. It has been

        comet of 1858. Mr. [now Sir George] Airy, the Astronomer Royal, is a
        man who has grown grey in the study of the stars; his energetic
        features indicate the incessant activity of the strong intellect
        which for more than a quarter of a century has upheld the reputation
        of Greenwich Observatory. On his writing-table were heaped a quantity
        of papers covered with calculations, and a maze of letters as to a
        thousand matters of business. A large iron cupboard contains all the
        precious documents which will, no doubt, one day serve to trace out
        the scientific history of the nineteenth century. Here, for instance,
        are preserved the letters and authentic documents which are destined
        to modify certain received opinions as to the discovery of the planet
        Neptune. In this cupboard may also be found the records of bygone
        errors and chimerical ideas, which one wonders to find reappearing in
        this enlightened age.</span></p>

        "tei tei-q">“It is difficult to believe that many amongst the English
        still confound astronomy with judicial astrology; but Mr. Airy

        all classes of persons, asking what his terms are for <span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">‘who will be his wife;’</span> at others it
        is a lady, on the eve of embarking in the great business of life, who
        desires to consult the stars. Postage-stamps are occasionally sent
        with these missives, and he or she who consults the oracle promises
        to make known, if necessary, the true day and hour of their birth.
        The fact is, that a great many people can scarcely understand how the
        astronomers can contemplate the vault of heaven by day and night
        without endeavouring to trace out the secret of human destiny. Some
        years back a young lady dressed in good taste applied at the door of
        the Observatory; she felt interested in one of her near relations, a
        sailor in the Pacific Ocean, from whom no news had been received for
        several years. After she had had a few minutes’ conversation with one
        of the assistants, she went away bathed in tears, because the stars
        were not able to tell her if the object of her affections were still
        alive.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the ground that
        Greenwich Park now occupies there once stood an ancient tower, built
        about the year 1440, by Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, and uncle to
        King Henry VI. In the time of Elizabeth it was called <span class=

        Wren pointed out the site of this fortress to Charles II. as the best
        place for the construction of an observatory. The old feudal tower
        was therefore pulled down, and over its remains was raised an edifice
        dedicated to the contemplation of the stars.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        installed in it, with the title of Astronomer Royal, and an emolument
        of £100 a year. He presided over the new establishment for more than
        half a century, and spent more than £2,000 of his own money. His
        works will always be looked upon in England as the starting point of
        modern astronomy. He may be deemed the founder of Greenwich
        observatory. His successors were Halley, Bradley, Nathaniel Bliss,
        and Dr. Nevil Maskelyn, the author of four volumes, of which it is
        said by Delampre, <span class="tei tei-q">‘that if, in consequence of
        some great revolution every record of science had been lost, with the
        exception of this collection, in it would be found materials quite
        sufficient for building up again the science of modern
        astronomy.’</span> Maskelyn was followed by John Pond, who died in
        1835; his place is now supplied by Mr. Airy.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The Astronomer Royal is nominated by the First Lord of
        the Treasury, and performs his functions under the warrant of the
        great seal of state; his salary is fixed at £800 per annum. One of
        his principal duties is to preserve for Greenwich observatory that
        character which the founder himself wished to impress upon it. The
        Astronomer Royal is therefore bound by the express terms of his
        commission, <span class="tei tei-q">‘to devote himself with the
        greatest care to correcting the tables of the celestial movements,
        and to determine the positions of the fixed stars, in order to
        furnish the long-desired means of discovering the longitude at sea,
        and of thus bringing to perfection the art of navigation.’</span> It
        is also necessary that he should reside in the observatory, and
        devote all his time to the duties of his office, never absenting
        himself for any long period without having previously obtained the
        sanction of the Lords of the Admiralty.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Consulted as he is by various branches of the
        Government, he is able to render assistance to the public service by
        his advice and information, well assured that he himself can never be
        affected by any of the changes in official power, or by any of the
        results of political conflict. His residence has a garden attached to
        it, which is parted off from the grounds of the park, and well
        planted with fruit-trees. He has under his control eight assistants,
        and ordinarily six computers.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“It is curious to see these computers in their two
        offices, one situated on the ground floor near the study of the
        Astronomer Royal, and the other isolated in one of the quietest parts
        of the observatory, all sedately occupied in reckoning up, from
        morning to night, dull columns of figures.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Before describing what Greenwich observatory
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">is</span></span>, it would be better perhaps to
        state first what it is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">not</span></span>. It relinquishes to other
        inquirers the task of discovering spots in the sun and mountains in
        the moon. The observations of the assistants are not directed either
        to the figures of the planets or to the extraordinary movements of
        the double stars, revolving one round the other in the depths of the
        firmament, or the mysteries of the nebulæ. What a firmness of
        character, what a truly English strength of will have these observers
        shown, in voluntarily drawing a veil over some of the most splendid
        wonders of the heavens! At the time of John Pond, a telescope twenty
        feet in length had been erected in the establishment at great
        expense, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg
        280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>but
        as it was a strong attraction to visitors, he caused the instrument
        to be dismantled. About the year 1847 Mr. Lerebours offered to
        Greenwich observatory the largest refracting telescope which had ever
        been constructed. The temptation was certainly a great one; it would
        have been flattering to the self-esteem of the institution to have
        possessed a wonder of this sort, unique as it was in the world. Mr.
        Airy need only to have said the word, and the Lords of the Admiralty
        would assuredly have made the purchase. But the Astronomer, on the
        contrary, held the present aloof with a determined hand. What was it
        that he feared? The perfidious influence of such a siren, which, by
        concentrating attention on the beauties of the heavens, would perhaps
        have turned away the attention of the assistants from their daily
        task, and have compromised the success of the Observatory.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“An observation of the sun takes place at least once a
        week at mid-day, in the transit circle room, and a large portion of
        the staff of the establishment take a part in it; but it is at night
        that one can form the best idea of the mode in which the transit of
        the heavenly bodies over the meridian is duly verified.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The first observations made with the new transit circle
        date from 1851, and, from that time to the present they have never
        been discontinued. The assistant who is appointed, aided by this
        instrument to watch the state of the heavens, is on guard for
        twenty-four hours, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, from three in the morning
        until three a.m. the next day. Except under extraordinary
        circumstances, the same duties are never assigned to an assistant two
        days running. Having already worked some hours after sunset, he goes
        home to take his evening meal, and when he returns into the transit
        circle room it is quite night. The shutters, which, during the day
        shut in a part of the ceiling, are now unclosed, and by means of this
        aperture the whole sky seems thrown open to the room.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Having consulted his list, and adjusted his telescope,
        he commences his steady gaze. His intentness can only be compared to
        that of a sportsman, or still better to that of a pointer dog, only,
        instead of a partridge or a woodcock, he is eagerly waiting to see a
        star get up. There it is at last! It comes into view quick and sudden
        as a meteor. Scarcely has it entered into the telegraphic field of
        sight than it appears to approach rapidly some objects which look
        like a series of transverse iron bars placed at equal distances from
        each other. These, however, in reality, are nothing but threads of
        the thickness of a spider’s web, stretched according to a system in
        the interior of the telescope, and wonderfully magnified by the power
        of the lenses.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The assistants are all astronomers by profession, and
        their eyes have been well trained by continual practice. How, then,
        can it happen, that their observations do not always prove accordant
        one with another? There is a physiological mystery hidden in the fact
        which it would be interesting to penetrate. Each observer, although
        operating with the same instrument and guided by the same plan,
        perceives a celestial phenomenon—as, for instance, the transit of a
        star—either sooner or later than another does. This variation is
        attributed to the idiosyncrasy of the sense of sight in each
        individual, or to the more or less prompt manner in which the eye
        telegraphs its impression to the brain. It must, of course, be quite
        understood that no considerable inequalities of time are in question
        here; it is, at the most, some fraction of a second that I am
        alluding to; but the astronomical transit observations are of so
        delicate a nature, that the slightest errors would destroy their
        worth. Under these circumstances it has been found necessary to
        establish an average or standard, and each observer gets to know
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281"
        id="Pg281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>precisely how far his visual
        faculties vary from the ideal. Hence arises a question,
        incomprehensible to the uninitiated, which, however, is commonly
        asked among astronomers themselves—<span class="tei tei-q">‘What is
        the value of your personal equation?’</span> This inquiry is answered
        by a figure expressing the particular amount of deviation from the
        standard. The most singular thing is, that the value of the personal
        equation is different in the same individual as regards the various
        celestial bodies. Some can very quickly discern the phenomena of a
        fixed star who are much slower in perceiving those of the moon, and
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice
        versâ</span></span>. In order to obviate the inconvenience which
        might result from the variations in personal equations, they also
        have recourse to a very ingenious plan. An eye-piece with two tubes
        allows two assistants simultaneously to observe the passage of the
        same star over the same threads in the instrument; <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>they both listen to the ticking of the
        clock marking the seconds, and separately calculate the results of
        their observations, which are afterwards compared. To obtain a
        greater degree of certitude, they occasionally exchange places. In
        this way the slightest chances of error are eliminated. The
        aberrations of the instrument must also be taken into account.
        Notwithstanding its excellence and the solidity with which it is
        fixed to stone walls sunk into the ground, it sometimes is affected
        by slight vibrations, which can only be attributed to the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">terra
        firma</span></span> on which it is constructed. Mr. Airy has noticed
        this same phenomenon at Cambridge, whence he has come to the
        conclusion <span class="tei tei-q">‘that the surface of the earth,
        commonly regarded as the base of all solidity, is itself in
        movement.’</span></span></p><a name="illo_308" id="illo_308" class=

        clock which sets the time for all England,’</span> said the
        Astronomer Royal to me, as he conducted me into a little room
        occupying one of the oldest parts of the edifice. Covered with its
        simple mahogany case, this <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Mother clock</span></span>, as it is called, is
        not unlike one of those venerable wooden-cased clocks that one meets
        with sometimes in the old English manor-houses. No one, however,
        could fail to discover that the mechanism in this time-keeper is new
        and uncommon. Its chief characteristic is that it possesses two
        distinct attributes. In the first place it marks the time most
        exactly; and, in the next, it communicates this power to other clocks
        as well. It has therefore been called the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mother
        clock</span></span>, because it animates in the Observatory eight of
        its <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">daughters</span></span>. Its dial is divided
        into three circles, one of which marks the hours, another the
        minutes, and a third the seconds. One hand only moves round each of
        these dials, and thus points out the generally-accepted measures of
        time.</span></p>

        known of the London Steam-packet Company, with some 700 happy
        merrymakers, a large proportion of whom were children, left London
        Bridge on Tuesday morning, September 3rd, 1878, for Gravesend and

        Woolwich Arsenal, with her living freight of gladsome excursionists.
        The song that comes when toil ceases, the careless laugh and harmless
        jest were going round; eager eyes watched the dim lights of home
        glinting through the purple September twilight, and no whispered
        thought of peril dulled the harmony of the day, when a large steam
        collier, the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=

        the gloom.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those who feared
        the least and knew the most from experience were the first to see the

        of both vessels, and the collision came. There was no time to

        during which it seemed that the <span class=

        told, which remains the greatest calamity that has yet befallen the
        British Navy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The army, however,
        suffered a loss nearly as appalling in the foundering of the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=

        Hope, where a contingent, made up from the 12th Lancers, 23rd and
        92nd Foot, helped to make up the 438 lives destroyed on that
        occasion, February 26, 1852. Nor were the greatest horrors entirely
        occasioned by the unruly elements and the sometimes pitiless sea, for
        added to these ever-impending dangers was the incombatable
        enemy—fire. The most heart-rending on record of these marine
        conflagrations was that which destroyed the S.S. <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style="font-style: italic">Austria</span></span>
        on its way from Hamburg to New York, U.S., on September 23, 1858. By
        this fire, out of 528 passengers and crew, 461 were either burnt to
        death or drowned; how many met the more horrible death of burning can
        never be known, nor is it well for the mind to dwell upon the painful
        subject. Going back a little farther we find the record of the
        burning of the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Ocean Monarch</span></span> in Abergele Bay,
        August 24, 1848, with loss of 178 lives. Then we have the S.S.
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=

        of Biscay on January 11, 1866, carrying down with her to a watery
        grave 239 out of a complement of 258. The wrecks of the <span class=

        an Australian clipper ship, was smashed to pieces on the coast of
        Anglesea on October 26, 1859, when, while some forty people or so
        managed to get on shore, 459 of men, women, and children, were added
        to the ocean sepulchre. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=

        struck on a sunken rock off Nova Scotia, April 1, 1873, and 481 out
        of 931 were lost. The <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=

        the death-roll by 393, by being driven on shore at Barra Island, one

        another emigrant ship, through carelessness in the reckoning, went
        ashore on the Wexford coast on April 28, 1859, losing 386 lives. And

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although the chief
        outward and visible sign of usefulness of the Seamen’s Hospital
        Society exists no longer on the Thames, many of our readers knew the
        old <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Dreadnought</span></span> well. She was the
        largest floating hospital in the world, and no other ship housed so
        cosmopolitan a crew as could be found among her 200 patients.
        Dysentery, scurvy, hepatic diseases in most varieties, and typhoid,
        were among the medical specialities to be seen on board, and it is
        probable that Budd gained much of his experience of enteric fever
        from this ship, which received annually from sixty to seventy cases
        of the disease. The surgical practice was equally useful, and we
        believe that the first resection (that of the shoulder) in London was
        performed by Busk on the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Dreadnought</span></span>. A large number of
        men, now teaching in our schools, gleaned useful knowledge here, and
        (an important matter in surgery) learnt how to do little things well.
        Although in maintaining a necessary and constant communication with
        the shore, there were the usual perils of water, including a strong
        current, a crowded stream, ice, &amp;c., no person engaged directly
        or indirectly in the business of the ship <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page286">[pg 286]</span><a name="Pg286" id="Pg286" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>was ever drowned during the half century that
        she and her predecessors were moored off Greenwich. The late Dr.
        Rooke, one of the ablest and kindest of the <span class=
        "tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Dreadnought’s</span></span> officers, nobly
        earned the Humane Society’s medal by saving a boy who fell off a
        barge close at hand; three patients jumped overboard at different
        times, in a state of delirium, but all were rescued and recovered.
        There were convivial gatherings now and again in the snug recess of
        the admiral’s cabin, used as a mess room by the medical staff. The
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Dreadnought</span></span> suffered many blows
        from without, and was run into seriously on several occasions. But
        the old ship stood it all, and was missed by the bargemen, who made a
        cushion of her wherewith to cannon off to the opposite shore. There
        can be no doubt that the managing committee of the Seamen’s Hospital
        Society acted wisely in removing their clients to a home on shore, so
        that we need not say altogether regretfully, although truly,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Take her all in all, we shall not look upon
        her like again.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of all the
        hospitals there is none so interesting as a sailor’s, and that at
        Greenwich, which represents the old <span class=

        "font-style: italic">Dreadnought</span></span> floating hospital, is
        particularly so. It is here Jack ashore is seen at his best, and his
        best is very good indeed as a general thing, especially when all the
        good qualities are developed as they are when he settles down to
        enjoy the autumn calm of his life, which generally begins in the
        hospital. Not only are there seamen from every clime, and every
        creed, too, here, but one ward is occupied by a few old naval
        pensioners. In this ward the first thing that attracts the eye, and
        is placed prominently over the fire-place, is Dibdin’s simple legend
        of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Sweet little cherub that sits up
        aloft.”</span> Every inmate of this ward could tell his interesting
        yarn of personal experiences of the Battle and the Breeze. One old
        fellow is both blind and deaf, and still happy and contented under
        the sympathetic care of an ancient cherub, who has sailed through
        three-quarters of a century of life’s uncertain tide. Why the blind
        tar should be called <span class="tei tei-q">“the nightingale”</span>
        has not been clearly stated, though the fact remains the same, and
        may possibly refer to great vocal powers. His messmate has been
        through enough battles to fill a volume; while another, an
        octogenarian marine, speaks with pride of the part he took in the
        <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Chesapeake</span></span> affair, which was
        beaten and captured <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        hailstones. But I remembers best when the king—God bless him!—sent
        out thirty barrels of porter, that me and the rest of us might drink
        his majesty’s health in; that was in the time of the war with
        Ameriky, and good times they was too,”</span> a little bit of
        individual opinion that no one would dream of controverting here.
        Next come we to another pensioner, who sits over the fire hugging his

        the hardy sons of our own isles. In one corridor there is even a
        Fantee, with the mark of his tribe upon his ebon-hued forehead, but
        minus feet, having lost them through their being frost-bitten in the
        Black Sea. Another and more painful case is that of a poor fellow
        wrecked off Cape Horn, who, drifting for fourteen days in an open
        boat, reached shore only to find that he must purchase life at the
        cost of both nether limbs. The surgical operator was an unskilled
        sailor, the instrument a rough ship’s knife, with which he succeeded
        in performing successfully the dangerous operation, but with what
        torture to the sufferer can too vividly be imagined. He is cheerful
        enough now as he potters about on his stumps, full of dry humour and
        as cheerful as any able-bodied man could be. The light occupations of
        these disabled sons of the sea are varied and congenial to their
        different tastes, and their labour is chiefly confined to decorating
        the wards of the hospital. Amongst the many inscriptions are a
        beautiful white wreath with <span class="tei tei-q">“Albert the
        Good”</span> on it, and Nelson’s famous last signal. One German
        sailor lad has entirely decorated one ward with a taste and elegance
        simply surprising. This boy is an original, seeing that he went all
        the way to Jerusalem to learn English! <span class="tei tei-q">“In
        Hamburg, his native place, he heard other boys, and occasionally
        travellers, say that there was a good school there where English was
        taught. Thereupon, seizing his opportunity, he worked his passage
        from Hamburg to Alexandria, took ship to Jaffa, and induced the
        German Consul to forward him to the Holy City.”</span> Evidently he

        Services are held on board troop, emigrant, and passenger ships,

        A chaplain (licensed by the Bishop of London to visit ministerially

        was by an Act of Parliament in 1836. The honorary members of this
        Court are men of distinction, including some of the members of the
        Royal Family. H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh became its Master in 1866.

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sea, the
        sailor, and the ship, have been fertile subjects for the poets,
        although countries and lands, and those who dwell therein, have
        occupied by far the larger part of their attention. Sooth to say,
        however, there has not yet arisen a single <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">great</span></span>
        writer whose name could fairly be identified with the ocean as its
        own particular poet. There may be reasons for this. The poet is
        usually of delicate organisation, and is more likely to be found
        studying Nature on the quiet shore than on the turbulent ocean. Maybe
        he is practically a recluse, accessible to a few only; and if of
        social nature, and not averse to companionship amid the busy haunts
        of men, he yet shrinks from the roughness usual to, though not
        inseparable from, the men of the sea. The modern facilities of
        travel, enabling the student to con Nature with comparative ease, may
        some day aid in producing a representative poet of the sea. At
        present the position is vacant.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In days of old,
        however, the poet prophets, David the sweet singer of Israel, and one
        or two writers in the New Testament, gave glimpses of the ocean which
        indicated an acquaintance with the subject. Nothing can well be finer
        than the Psalmist’s conception of the mariner’s life and its dangers
        in the lines commencing:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business
        in great waters;</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“These see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the
        deep.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The prophet
        Jeremiah draws a beautiful though pathetic picture of the ocean’s
        unrest when he says: <span class="tei tei-q">“There is sorrow on the
        sea, it cannot be quiet;”</span> and the serious poets have followed
        his outlines. Milton describes one—</p>

            <span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: left">“In a troubled
            sea of passion tossed.”</span>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Michelet defines
        its <span class="tei tei-q">“many voices,”</span> its murmur and its
        menace, its thunder and its roar, its wail, its sigh, its
        <span class="tei tei-q">“sublime duets with the rocks.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The classical
        writers of antiquity had little sympathy with the sea. We have seen

        id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Horace’s opinion of that man’s
        boldness who first trusted himself in a frail vessel on the merciless
        ocean; and, as Dryden shows us, there was good reason for a general
        dread of the sea, at least on the part of landsmen—</p>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Virgil’s
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Æneid”</span> is essentially a sea-poem, yet
        a writer of critical acumen considers that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“in literature the sea is all the worse for Virgil having
        dealt with it.... The poem, as nobody needs telling, begins its
        events with a tremendous sea-piece. In the very first sight we get of
        the hero and his companions they are dividing the foaming brine with
        their keels, and the initial incident is a shipwreck. The description
        assuredly has overwhelming vigour in it...; an impression of unusual
        turmoil is given, and that is what Virgil sought, but it is got by a
        jumble of violence of every kind. Winds, billows, lightning, thunder,
        reefs, shallows, eddies, are mixed together. The only detail of
        disaster left out is collision among the ships, which with a fleet so
        crowded is the one thing that would have occurred had this been a
        natural storm. Such a tempest now rages in a transpontine theatre,
        and in no other part of the world; it takes Neptune himself to still
        it in the <span class="tei tei-q">‘Æneid.’</span> ”</span><a id=
        "noteref_86" name="noteref_86" href="#note_86"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">86</span></span></a> And yet
        Virgil lived long by the glorious Bay of Naples; and the famous ode
        of Horace, praying that he might have fair weather, shows that he had
        made at least one voyage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If a poet has a
        genuine feeling for his subject, the lightest epithets he applies may
        tell a story. What terms does Virgil employ? They are somewhat
        commonplace. Boundless, mighty, swelling, windy, faithless, deep,
        dark, blue, azure, vast, foaming, salt, and so forth, are well
        enough, but they do not compare with many of Shakespeare’s, and later
        poets. Take three of Shakespeare’s: the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“yeasty”</span> waves, the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“multitudinous”</span> sea, and the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“wasteful”</span> ocean. These epithets are in themselves
        admirable descriptions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The works of our
        immortal bard are full of allusions to the sea, and show an intimate
        acquaintance therewith. Perhaps Shakespeare’s knowledge is in this
        instance less surprising than in some other directions, for although
        we have no proof that he ever left the shores of old England, and are
        quite certain that he never ventured far, his was a golden day in the
        history of maritime enterprise. The reign of the Virgin Queen, during
        the larger part of which he flourished, saw the defeat of the Armada,
        and many another repulse in the Spanish colonies. It was the day of
        such naval heroes as Howard of Effingham, Drake and Hawkins, Raleigh
        and Frobisher. It witnessed the first English voyage round the world,
        the discovery of Virginia—to say nothing of Virginia’s tobacco and
        potatoes—the establishment of the profitable whale fishery and the
        disgraceful slave-trade, the inauguration of that long-time monopoly
        the East India Company, and numerous lesser developments in
        commercial prosperity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Appropriately,
        then, the play of Shakespeare which more particularly than any other
        deals with the sea is that which is generally placed at the
        commencement of the series in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page292">[pg 292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class=

        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tempest</span></span>
        opens with a storm <span class="tei tei-q">“on a ship at sea.”</span>
        The fury of the gale increases, and the vessel is nearly on the
        rocks. <span class="tei tei-q">“We split! we split! we split!”</span>
        sings out the honest old Neapolitan councillor, Gonzalo, adding—</p>

        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">par
        excellence</span></span> of the sea, partly on account of the
        literary merits of his production, but more by reason of his
        technical correctness, was William Falconer, the author of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The Shipwreck,”</span> on the title pages of
        all the older editions of which he is described simply as
        <span class="tei tei-q">“a sailor.”</span> His poem, which is in
        three cantos, was founded on actual incidents in a shipwreck from
        which himself and but two or three of the crew were saved. Again, in
        1769 he embarked on board the <span class="tei tei-name"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Aurora</span></span> frigate on a venture to the
        East Indies, but from the time the ship left the Cape of Good Hope no
        information was ever received of her, and she is believed to have
        foundered with all hands, including the poet. Falconer, although a
        disciple of the Muse, wrote a political satire, entitled,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The Demagogue;”</span> while his Marine
        Dictionary is, in its revised form, a recognised authority to-day.
        The poem on which his fame rests is remarkable for the absolute
        correctness of its details. Take, for example, the following passage,
        which could not have been written by a
        landsman-poet:—</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg

        wonderful that so many of our poets have written more or less
        concerning the sea, few passing over the grand subject entirely, when
        we consider England’s paramount position on and interests in it. A
        number of them have produced works in which we seem to sniff the
        briny ocean as we read them, while only a minority have written
        artificially and without a true feeling for their subject. Much that

        himself, is of a trivial nature, dealing largely—too largely—with
        grog and sweethearts, and more than occasionally verging on the
        coarse and indelicate. But among their productions are songs with the
        true ring, ballads that will never die while our language lasts or

        specially disastrous to France, and a fleet of twenty-two vessels
        were hotly and closely pursued by the English. The squadron came
        helter-skelter, <span class="tei tei-q">“like a crowd of frightened
        porpoises”</span> with the sharks after them, to St. Malo on the
        Rance. The pilots who were on board laughed at the bare idea of their
        great ships entering the rocky passage; and Damfreville, the admiral
        of the fleet, was seriously thinking of blowing up or burning all his
        ships, when out stepped in front of all the assembled officers a poor
        coasting-pilot.</p>

        rogues?”</span> said he, as he hurriedly and impetuously assured the

        in safely.</p>

            anchor in the roadstead of Yokohama, on the 24th of August, 1872,
            was destroyed by fire. In seven minutes after the first flames
            were discovered the ship from stem to stern was one sheet of
            flame. At the last moment the captain, terribly burnt, threw
            himself in the water and was rescued. Three Europeans and sixty
            Chinamen were either burnt to death or drowned. The Chinese,
            determined not to lose their savings, dawdled a little, and then
            threw themselves all together on a ladder, which broke with their
            weight. The gold found on their corpses proved that not one had

            signals, which are illustrated in our plate. This name is given

            "tei tei-q">“produced by means of a disc, with twelve radial
            slits, being made to rotate in front of a fixed disc exactly
            similar. The moving disc revolves 2,800 times a minute, and in
            each revolution there are, of course, twelve coincidences between
            the two discs; through the openings thus made steam or air at
            high pressure is allowed to pass, so that there are actually
            twelve times 2,800 (or 33,600) puffs of steam or compressed air
            every minute. This causes a sound of very great power, which the
            cast-iron trumpet, twenty feet in length, compresses to a certain
            extent, and the blast goes out as a sort of sound-beam in the
            direction required.”</span> The Siren, which was originally
            designed in New York, and was first adopted by the American
            Lighthouse Board, can be heard in all kinds of weather at from
            two-and-a-half to three miles, and on favourable occasions at as
            many as sixteen miles out at sea.</dd>

              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important

              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
